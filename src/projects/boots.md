With the never ending stress of class work and buggy code, I like to have a
completely unplugged project going through a school year that allows me to
destress. Typically this is a pair of earrings or a tshirt that I can finish
in an hour one weekend. I accidentally started a new project that may take
many weekends.

I've been getting a lot of those targeted ads for embroidered boots. Most of
them are floral themed, some are astrology themed. They all cost more money than
I'm willing to spend on a pair of shoes. I decided I could probably figure out
how to make a pair for myself.

I found of Doc Marten canvas shoes for $6 at the thrift store and got started. I
drew up designs, redyed the shoes to refresh the color, then when transferring
the deigns onto the shoes, I realized I wasn't going to be able to get the
effect I wanted. I found a different pair of boots I already had and decided to
jump in there instead. I'll find a different project for the Docs. The boots are
too thick to embroider as is. My plan is to create a "cover" then sew it on top
of the boot. I'll make a proper write up when I'm done.

**Sketch Plans:** These were originally for the Docs, but change of plans. I'm
adapting them for the boots.
