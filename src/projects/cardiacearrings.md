# CARDIAC Earrings

On the 7th, my 360 freshmen took their final exam. We then spent a little over
12 hours the next day grading the exams. On my way to exam grading I thought
about how I wish I had a pair of earrings for CS-164. During a 30 minute break,
I printed out the CARDIAC and made a pair of earrings. I normally wouldn't post
such a quick earrings project, but these are really cute.

I got the graphics for the computer from
[this Instructables post](https://www.instructables.com/CARDIAC-CARDboard-Illustrative-Aid-to-Computation-/)

I got the image for the manual from the
[CS-164 material Dr. Stuart uses](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardiac.html).
The manual has three pages in it, the first is the assembly code for a running
sum and count. The second is the machine code for the same program. This is the
the code for the fifth lab in CS-164. The last page of the manual is just the
CPU diagram for the CARDIAC we teach in CS-164. This was a fun quick pair of
earrings that turned out absolutely adorable. I made a pair for myself and the
other TA who's graduating this year.
