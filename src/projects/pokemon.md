# Pokemon Card Website

I've been collecting Pokemon cards since 2011ish. I've always had them lying
around. In middle school 2011/2012 is when I distinctly started getting a lot
and taking proper care of them. In 2018 I decided to finally find out how many
cards I had and their values. This started the many day long process of
organizing my cards into an Excel spreadsheet. This was convenient at the time.
In 2019, I transferred the spreadsheets to CSV files and built a site using
some nightmarish Python scripts and JavaScript functions. After getting out of
my little "web dev" phase, I decided to rebuild in 2020 using something more
sustainable and aligned with my goals.

Currently the site is hosted on GitHub pages and is comprised entirely of static
HTML generated by Bash and Awk scripts. All the cards are stored in plain text
CSV files. The CSV files act as a very basic relational database to store both
the card information and the sets they belong to.
