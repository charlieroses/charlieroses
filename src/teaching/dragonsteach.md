# DragonsTeach

DragonsTeach is a program at Drexel where by taking a certain number of classes,
students are able to get K-12 teaching certifications. ESTM-201 is the first
course in the sequence. I intended on completing the sequence before realizing
teaching K-12 was not for me.

Weekly class sessions at Drexel were focused around creating lesson plans for
elementary school students and how to handle classroom issues if they arose. In
addition to this, Every other week we attended a class at Julia R Masterman
Laboratory and Demonstration School. Class sessions at Masterman alternated
between observations and teaching. We'd first watch their teacher give a lesson,
then, myself and two group members would teach a class from a lesson plan we had
made. My group was assigned 5th grade math. The two class sessions we taught
were about statistics and proportions.
