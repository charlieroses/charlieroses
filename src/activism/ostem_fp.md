# oSTEM at Drexel University - Founding President

I founded
[oSTEM at Drexel University](https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/drexelostem)
after facing transphobia from my teaching assistant my freshman year and being
unhappy with how the situation was addressed. It opened my eyes to the lack of
representation of the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. From this, I wanted to start a
student organization that mimicked the goals and success of the Women in
Computing Society (WiCS) student organization. From my research, I learned about
the
[Out in STEM National Organization](https://ostem.org/).

Starting in the Winter of 2018 I spent about six months building our founding
executive board. Due to Drexel's timeline for student organizations, we were
unable to become a recognized self governed student organization until Fall of 2019.
We spent our first year operating out of the Center for the Advancement of
STEM Learning and Teaching Excellence (CASTLE), utilizing their resources to
host three events without recognition.

oSTEM at Drexel was operational as a
[recognized student organization](https://drexel.edu/cci/stories/drexel-ostem-chapter-receives-recognition-from-national-society/)
for approximately six months before the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine hit. The
entire executive board was faced with personal hardship. We were forced to step
back from the organization. oSTEM folded and lost recognition.
