# QWER Hacks @ UCLA 2022

[QWER Hacks @ UCLA](https://www.qwerhacks.com/)
is
[Major League Hacking's (MLH)](https://mlh.io/)
first LGBTQIA+ hackathon. This years theme was _Embracing Identity Through Self
Empowerment_ and had four tracks: _Community & Connection_, _Health & Wellness_,
_Learning & Growth_, and _Art & Expression_.

While the event lasted from January 21st through the 23rd, I hosted my workshop
on Saturday, the 22nd. This was the first workshop I've ever hosted outside of
Drexel and it was pretty exciting to put together. My workshop was titled
_Accidental Activism in Academia_ and was focused around my journey in starting
my activism work and how to do it intentionally.
