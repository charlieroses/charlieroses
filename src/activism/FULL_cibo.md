# The Coalition of Identity-Based Organizations (CIBO)

On May 4th, 2022, the Director of the Student Center for Diversity and Inclusion
(SCDI) announced his departure from the position. Four months later, on
[September 8th, 2022](https://drexel.edu/equity-inclusive-culture/about/announcements/2022/September/introducing-eic/)
Drexel's Office of Equality and Diversity (OED) announced they were rebranding
into the
[Office of Institutional Equity and Inclusive Culture (EIC)](https://drexel.edu/equity-inclusive-culture/)
and aquired the SCDI and Spiritual and Religious Life (SRL). These offices used
to be a part of the Office of Student Life due to their service to the student
body and their connection to student organizations. In my work with
[oSTEM](index.html#ostem_fp),
the [Queer People of Color (QPOC)](https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/qpoc),
and the [Queer Student Union (QSU)](https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/queer-student-union)
student organizations, I've done a lot of research into the history of the SCDI
and its connection to these organizations.

As a quick sidebar, before the SCDI, there existed the Student Center for
Inclusion and Culture (SCIC). In 2012, the Foundation of Undergraduates for
Sexual Equality (FUSE) [petitioned](https://www.change.org/p/drexel-university-support-creation-of-lgbtq-center)
for the creation of an LGBTQA Student Center which [opened in 2013](https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2013/october/lgbtqa-student-center).
In 2015, [QPOC was created](https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2015/may/qpoc_first_year)
by SCDI student worker and LGBTQA Center staff member Chantanae Singletary. In
2017, the SCIC and LGBTQA Student Center merged to form the SCDI. Also in 2017,
FUSE was rebuilt into QSU with the help of the SCDI to address FUSE's history of
exclusion. In 2018, I started oSTEM which was formally recognized in 2019. This
started an incredible 6 month period where the SCDI student employees and oSTEM,
QPOC, and QSU executive boards collaborated on [events](https://www.thetriangle.org/news/student-unions-do-transgender-day-of-remembrance-work/)
and [fundraisers](https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/event/5162335).
When the pandemic hit in March 2020, many executive board members needed to
prioritize their personal lives and stepped back.
While online for nearly 2 years, generations of executive boards went by and
this history of collaboration was nearly lost; leaving the organizations to
struggle alone. Prior to the EIC announcement, I was working with the queer
student organizations to learn this history to build a stronger future.

When the EIC announcement hit, immediately I was concerned how the move of the
SCDI from Student Life to EIC would impact this important connection between the
SCDI and the queer student organizations. I researched the history of OED. As an
active student advocate on campus, I worked with a lot of offices on campus. I
hadn't worked with OED much. In my research, I learned that OED has longstanding
connections to Human Resources (HR) and has historically been focused on
[compliance](https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2013/October/QandA-with-Michele-Rovinsky-Mayer).
OED had started to branch into more supportive services, but these were
primarily focused on faculty, professional staff, and university employees. I
also found the job posting for the replacement of the Director of the SCDI that
had been posted on September 2nd. What used to be a Director had now become an
Associate Director.

This history and the demotion of the SCDI's leadership was worrying. As a
student, I relied on the services the SCDI provided.
[The Ball](https://drexel.edu/studentlife/activities-involvement/programs-traditions/the-ball)
served as a [Lavendar Graduation](https://www.hrc.org/resources/lavender-graduation)
for queer seniors to receive their [[rainbow cord]](files/rainbowcord.jpg)
for graduation. I've [spoken before](../blogposts/20211119/tdor.html)
about the how important the [Transgender Day of Remembrance](https://www.glaad.org/tdor)
services are to me. Even beyond specific events and resources, the SCDI was a
place where students could simply exist and find community. I wouldn't be
"Charlie" without the connections I made in the SCDI. Other students deserve to
have this resource and these opportunities.

I wrote an
[[extensive letter]](files/EICLetter.pdf) covering the history of the offices
and how the current restructuring presented many concerns for the future of the
SCDI and the student organizations that rely on it. I sent it to EIC
administration and scheduled a meeting for a month later.

In the meantime, Luis Benitez reached out to me regarding his concerns with the
restructure. He's an SCDI student worker and on the executive board of multiple
student organizations. He'd been experiencing many issues after the
restructuring. He looked to University of Pennsylvania's structure for student
support and proposed a list of short-term and long-term goals to the
Undergraduate Student Goverment Association (USGA). After his initial proposal,
he started reaching out to other student organization leaders for support which
led him to me. We ended up meeting and realized our concerns and goals
overlapped.

Since then, we formed CIBO to provide support for identity-based student
organizations that are frequently called upon to act as the voice of their
communities. We organized conferences with all the student organizations and had
more meetings than we can count. After months of research and planning, we
created a [[petition]](files/CIBOPetition.pdf) to create systemic support for
student advocacy in EIC.

This petition was circulated amongst the executive boards of the identity-based
student organizations. In just one week, we collected 92 signatures from
representatives from 32 identity-based organizations. The signed petition was
sent to administration on December 8th. We set a deadline to start negotiations
of January 20th, 2023. Otherwise, we'd make the petition public to collect
signatures from the entire Drexel community. We also set the condition that the
appointment of an Associate Director of the SCDI would result in the publication
of the petition regardless of the original deadline as we believe it's unethical
to bring in a new employee to a position where the office they will preside over
and the organizations they will partner with are actively petitioning against
their role.

On December 13th, we were told the hiring round would continue as planned and
offers would be extended shortly. This demonstrated an intent to appoint an
Associate Director of the SCDI without petition negotiations. We made this clear
to administration and told them our plans to publicly post this petition on
December 16th at 12pm EST unless they alerted us otherwise.

We're now entering the public phase of this petition process. It's
[posted](https://chng.it/JzgfX5RFHK)
on change.org and being circulated across Drexel. We still plan on starting
negotiations in January, but given how this journey has gone so far, there's no
way to plan for what comes next. I'm excited for the future of CIBO and I'm so
thankful that I've been able to be a part of this process.
