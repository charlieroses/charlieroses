# The Coalition of Identity-Based Organizations (CIBO)

- Wrote an extensive letter to Drexel University's administration regarding the findings of my self-led
research on the full history of Drexelâ€™s university-wide DEI initiatives and solutions to prevent the
devastating consequences the current restructure plans will have on students
- Organizing 150+ student leaders from all 30+ identity-based student organizations to form CIBO, a
student advocacy network
- Designed a petition signed by CIBO representatives to build official channels for student advocacy and
support within the university and sent to administration on December 8th
- Serving as the bridge to aid student leaders in effectively communicating and achieveing their needs
with Drexe's administration
