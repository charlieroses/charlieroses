<h3 class="po" id="or">Opening Remarks</h3>

I'm entering today more refreshed after taking a break last night. I'm trying to
remain optimistic. There is one more day of the main conference I'm attending.
There are many opportunities for growth.

The keynote speaker was [Cecilia Aragon](https://ceciliaaragonauthor.com/).
She's a latina woman who was a Olympic
[Aerobatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobatics) Pilot before getting her
PhD and becoming a professor.

I really enjoyed her talk, especially about her early life. She talked about how
both her parents have thick accents, which had her placed in slower reading and
writing classes in school. She once spent extra time writing an essay in order
to be very precise and articulate. Her teachers accused her of plagiarism
because "someone like her couldn't have written that". From this she was drawn
to math, science, and computing. She talked a lot about her personal fears and
insecurities. She talked about how she used to be afraid of heights and now
she's a pilot doing tricks in a plane at 250mph. I didn't take any notes here, I
wanted to just experience her talk.

<h3 class="py" id="bp">Diversity Best Practices</h3>

I went to the workshop titled **Increasing Diversity in Computing: Sharing of
Good Practices**. I was expecting more of a workshop type situation where we'd
get advice on practices and things we can implement. Instead, there was an
introductory video where each organization was featured. Then there were break
out rooms where you could meet each organization and ask questions. The
organizations were:

- [AccessComputing](https://uw.edu/accesscomputing)
	- Dedicated to increasing the participation of people with disabilities in
		computing fields
- [CAHSI](https://cahsi.utep.edu/)
	- The Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institutions
- [CMD-iT](https://cmd-it.org/)
	- The Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities in IT
	- Hosts of the Tapia Conference
- [CRA-WP](https://cra.org/cra-wp/)
	- Computing Research Association - Widening Participation
- [ECEP](https://ecepalliance.org/)
	- Expanding Computing Education Pathways
- [iAAMCS](http://www.iaamcs.org/)
	- The Institute for African American Mentoring in Computing Sciences
- [NCWIT](https://ncwit.org/)
	- The National Center for Women & Information Technology
- [STARS Computing Corps](http://starscomputingcorps.org/)
	- Taking action for diversity, equity, and inclusion in computing

It was really disappointing to once again, see no representations for LGBTQ+
centered organizations. However, many of these I had not heard of before, so
maybe they have LGBTQ+ initiatives within their organizations.

When break out rooms opened, I started with CRA-WP. I am really concerned about
graduate school, so I felt that they would be the best group to help me there.
When I joined, I talked with the representative about my situation and how many
fellowships and funding opportunities that talk about diversity don't apply to
me since the LGBTQ+ is consistently overlooked. The representative didn't have
any answers. The fellowship on their website states:

> NSF seeks candidates from a broad array of backgrounds and strongly encourages
> women, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native
> Hawaiians, Native Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities to apply.

So while it is encouraged their list of underrepresented groups in STEM apply,
everyone is eligible. This means I'm allowed to apply even as a "white man". The
representative was really uneducated about LGBTQ+ issues as a whole and
recommended I go to the NCWIT break out room, since they might be more involved
with gender issues. She also recommended I attend Grace Hopper, as they might
have more LGBTQ+ resources. She gave me her email and told me to contact her
about their grad cohort. I'll do that when I'm done here today.

So I moved onto the NCWIT break out room. I explained my overarching grad school
situation and then how I was visiting after talking with CRA-WP. Once again,
they didn't have much for LGBTQ+ people as a whole. The representative from
NCWIT did recommend I check out <www.aspirations.org> and see if I applied for
their awards. The awards state:

> The NCWIT Collegiate Award honors the outstanding computing accomplishments of
> undergraduate and graduate women, genderqueer, or non-binary students.

While this is more inclusive, it shows a frequent frustration of mine. Commonly,
women and nonbinary identities are grouped together to create a community of
"not-men". The term "womxn" is frequently used here to create a space for women
while "crossing-out" men. This causes issues in practice because we're now
creating a "men vs not-men" mentality. At first there appears to be no issue.
Cisgender men have dominated positions of power. The keyword here is
"cisgender". Transgender and nonbinary men have not openly upheld those same
power structures. Transgender and nonbinary men can play a role in those
structures by closeting themselves, but by disclosing their identities, they too
are put in discriminatory situations alongside women and nonbinary people. Not
only does the "not-men" mentality exclude trans and nonbinary men who are also
hurt by the cis male centric power structures, but it includes nonbinary people
with women. Nonbinary people exist outside of the traditional gender binary.
Some nonbinary people identify with a specific third gender, or a mix of male
and female, or just femininity, or just masculinity, or absolutely no gender at
all, or things I didn't even mention. So by stating "women and nonbinary", we're
grouping nonbinary people with a binary gender. Some nonbinary people are
comfortable with this, but many are not as it directly contradicts their
identity. In practice, these "women and nonbinary" groups tend to exclude
AMAB[^1] nonbinary people, nonbinary people who reject femininity, and nonbinary
people who are comfortable with masculinity. So coming back to the topic at
hand, this award shows that it's for women and some LGBTQ+ people, but not all.

The NCWIT representative also recommended I look into
[The Last Mile Education Fund](https://www.lastmile-ed.org). They're a group who
gives grants to people experiencing financial hardship that poses a threat to
their education. In the five minutes I've scrolled through their site, it
appears they have three grants. Emergency Mini-Grants which are rapid grants for
short term obstacles. There's Bridge Grants which help students overcome
"potentially catastrophic financial hurdles such as a car repair, medical
expense, loss of employment, and required devices or equipment for your major."
They also can be used for career development opportunities like applications,
conferences, research opportunities, and more. Then there are the large Last
Mile Grants which are for tuition and degree completion. I'm really lucky I
heard about this. I've been sharing it with my friends with financial struggles.
I'll put in some applications later.

As the event finished, I did get the following message from a participant:

> Thank you for so openly sharing your story!  You are doing great things in
> light of life's hurdles

That was nice to hear.

<h3 class="pg" id="cc">Candid Conversations</h3>

The final workshop I attended was titled **A Seat At The Table: Candid
Conversation on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**. The speaker was incredibly
charismatic. He was very engaging. He was also very open about the exact
discrimination and hate he's experienced as a Black man.

I took a lot of notes, but I'm not gonna copy all of them. There was a lot of
redundant information, and especially towards the end he was rushing, so I
couldn't take notes.

To start, he covered the importance of candid conversations. They give us the
ability to turn a difficult conversation into a painless learning experience.
They give us a chance to talk about topics that are meaningful to use and also
to gain new perspectives. He followed it with the quote:

> "Seek to understand before being understood"
>
> Stephen Covey, _7 Habits of Highly Effective People_

We also talked about the difference between equity and equality. Equality being
everyone treated the same. Equity being everyone treated different based on
their needs. The example always used is a
[graphic](https://interactioninstitute.org/the-4th-box-sparks-imagination/)
about a baseball game. Three
people are trying to see a baseball game over a fence. The first is tall and can
see over the fence without any help. The second and third are medium and short
heights and cannot see over the fence. Equality is giving each person a 1 foot
box to stand on. The tall person can still see over the fence just find. The
medium height person can now see over the fence. The short person is still not
tall enough to see over the fence. Equity would be giving the tall person no
boxes to stand on, the medium height person one box, and the short person two
boxes. Everyone can see over the fence based on the way we addressed each need
individually. He also included another part of this graphic to demonstrate
reality, where the tall person has many boxes, the medium height person has one,
and the short person is standing in a hole. I've also seen a fourth version
where there's no boxes given to anyone. Instead of giving people boxes, the
fence was removed. Now everyone can see the game without obstacle. This one was
titled liberation, and represented the removal of the systemic barrier.

He then had four people read a dialogue out loud. No one was participating so I
volunteered first. Other people ended up volunteering. I was the only person to
mention my pronouns.

> Diversity asks "Who's in the room?" <br>
> Equity responds "Who is trying to get in the room but can't? Who's presence in
> the room is under constant threat of safety or removal?" <br>
> Inclusion asks "Have everyone's ideas been heard?" <br>
> Justice responds "Whose ideas won't be taken as seriously because they're not
> in the majority"

> Diversity asks "How many more of each marginalized group do we have this year
> compared to last year?" <br>
> Equity responds "What conditions have we created to maintain the existing
> majority?" <br>
> Inclusion asks "Is this environment safe for everyone to belong?" <br>
> Justice responds "Whose safety is being sacrificed and minimized to allow
> others to be comfortable maintaining dehumanizing roles?"

The dialogue does a good job explaining justice's role in diversity, equity, and
inclusion. One attendee mentioned "Good presentation. However, the exercise was
not inclusive." I privately messaged them thanking them for speaking up and
asked them to elaborate. They didn't respond. I believe it was because the
exercise required us to read from the slides being screen shared, and that
visually impaired people who use screen readers would not have been able to
participate.

We covered how stereotypes in media create a unconscious bias in our brains.
These biases, whether we are aware of them or not, lead to judgements. We see
people and make assumptions based on our unconscious biases, whether we intend
to or not. If we don't actively acknowledge and work against these biases and
judgements, they turn into behaviors and discrimination. We need to
acknowledge we all have unconscious biases, learn what they are, understand
them, and start to self correct.

We covered the difference between microaggressions and macroaggressions. A
microaggression is a comment or action that unintentionally expresses a
prejudiced attitude against someone based on their minority status.
Macroaggressions are verbal and physical assaults. These are intentional actions
taken against someone based on their minority status.

So then, we answered some questions as a group. I'll leave these as a bulleted
list. These questions were focused specifically around racism against Black
people in America. I've rephrased some of them to be more universal about having
candid conversations. Others I've left as is. The lessons still apply.

**How do I lead the candid conversation with other people so I can understand
their feelings and viewpoints?**

- Clarify intents. Focus on positive outcomes, learning, and growing.
- Use "we" and "I" statements instead of "they" and "you"
- Identify personal triggers and uncomfortable topics
- Check your assumptions at the door
- Be prepared to consider other perspectives

**How do you teach people to be more receptive to a candid conversation?**

- Recognize the consequences of not having the conversation
- They could be faced with lawsuits if their behavior is discriminatory
- Recognize the current consequences for marginalized group and prevent more

**What happens when non-people of color look at their community's 
Anti-Blackness[^2]?**

- Recognize the environment they were raised in and be introspective about
	its effects
- The only thing you can change is yourself, not other people, not a herd's
	mentality

**How do you deal with White Fragility[^3]?**

- The book _White Fragility_ by [Robin DiAngelo](https://www.robindiangelo.com/)
	- Attendees had a lot of good things to say about Robin DiAngelo and other
		work she does
- Start with reflection
	- How have I been shaped by any racist system?
	- Am I complicit in racist structures even if they go against my values and
		beliefs
- Listen to people of color with intention
	- Read books by them
	- Listen to music by them
	- Learn their history
	- Learn their present
	- Go with the intention of changing your perspective, learning, and growing
- Humility is key
	- Accept you've made mistakes, intentionally or not
	- Work to prevent future mistakes
	- Be prepared to learn and grow

**What can we do?**

- Begin to be aware of our unconscious biases
- Communicate the importance of managing biases
- Host trainings and workshops
- Make employee resource groups easy to access and participate in
- Build diverse talent network and teams
- Create an environment that works for everyone, if it doesn't work for
	everyone, be prepared to change it
- Connect your DEI mission and values to your organization mission and values
- Build a place where every is safe

This quote was on a slide, so I wrote it down. It's really been applicable to my
experiences at this conference.

> Stop expecting others to act first. Be the one who makes a positive change.
> It starts with you.

<h3 class="pb" id="ct">Closing Thoughts</h3>

I'm sad I missed the closing ceremony. My dog has been sick all day and was
giving me issues. I'll do closing thoughts for the day, then probably tomorrow
make a comprehensive final opinions post about the conference as a whole.

Today wasn't as emotionally draining as yesterday. I'm still disappointed there
were no organizations based around LGBTQ+ inclusion during the
[Diversity Best Practices](#bp) workshop. The organizations I spoke to didn't
seem to have many resources, initiatives, or education on the LGBTQ+ community,
which added insult to injury. However, I did gain valuable advice and resources
there, which I'm appreciative of. I will admit I felt better about today, even
if I was disappointed by what was missing.
