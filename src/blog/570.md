# COVID-19 and a Graduate Class

I have been the Head TA for the graduate course, CS-570, at Drexel University
for the spring term of 2020. Over the course of the term, our professor got
COVID-19 and I was left in charge of the course. This is a daily log of what
that experience was like, taking over the course unexpectedly and taking on
new responsibilities. It is a very long post, but it fully lists everything
that happened and how I handled it. At the end I have a little "What I Learned"
blurb. The experience was stressful, but I learned so much and everything 
worked out.


<h3 class="pr">Tuesday, May 26th</h3>

Lecture is normally every Tuesday from 6pm-9pm. This was supposed to be the 
eighth lecture of the term. Due to the global pandemic, Drexel's ten week term
has been shortened to a nine week term. That means this is supposed to be the
second to last lecture of the term. 

The professor starts the lecture stating she is sick. She has a sore throat. 
She asks us to be patient with her. She ends up having a really rough time 
speaking and ends lecture in 45 minutes.

At the time I didn't think anything of it. At this point, we had been in 
quarantine in Philly for about two months. We hadn't heard much about COVID-19
in a while. It did not cross my mind that she was infected.

<h3 class="po">Saturday, May 30th</h3>

We got a email today from the professor. We hadn't heard much from her at this
point. The subject line was "Bad News" which was worrying. The email was very
brief. The professor had caught COVID-19 and now has pneumonia. She asked me to
take charge of lecture on Tuesday. I drew up a plan. I knew the topic fairly
well and I have lecturing experience, so I wasn't too worried. The TA I work
with asked if she could have a chance to lecture since she's never done it
before. We only expected to cover the lecture.

I sent out an announcement to the class. I told them all the professor was 
still sick, and that myself and the other TA would be in charge of lecture. 
Students were comfortable with me lecturing as I've done it before in this 
course. I received lots of well wishes for the professor. I got one message
from a student, "i hope she's going to be ok. its not the 'rona, is it?". I 
ended up not responding. The whole experience was very chilling.

<h3 class="py">Monday, June 1st</h3>

Normally, we would have we a weekly Monday meeting with the professor to talk
about the week ahead and grading. Instead, myself and the other TA used the 
time to plan out lecture.

<h3 class="pg">Tuesday, June 2nd</h3>

This is the last lecture of the term. I didn't realize that until I had finished
the lecture. Overall, everything went smoothly. We covered all the material as 
needed. Lots of students asked questions I couldn't answer about the final and
the professor's health.

After lecture, I sent the professor an update email detailing how lecture went
and asking a few questions relating to the remainder of the course. I told 
myself if I didn't have a response by the end of the next day I'd contact the 
department heads on moving forward. There's a lot of time sensitive grades that
need to be dealt with. I don't have time to wait for a response that may never
come.

<h3 class="pb">Wednesday, June 3rd</h3>

I didn't hear back from the professor today. So I contacted the department 
heads. I got a near instantaneous response that they'd be meeting the next day
to discuss moving forward.

<h3 class="pp">Thursday, June 4th</h3>

Today is my first day of doing a daily log. I wrote the past few days to start.
Today was a big day.

I woke up to a long email chain from the department heads, and our department 
technology services master. All they had were final exam questions the professor
had prepped. Thankfully, she had prepped 265 different exam questions. The tech
manager had these all loaded into our Drexel systems for me. We use BlackBoard
Learn at Drexel to host our grades. There were a few questions for me to address
in their emails. I planned a meeting with our undergraduate department head. 
While she isn't the graduate department head, she assigns me courses as a TA and
I've worked with her before.

I met with our undergrad department head. We went over how to create a final from
the list of questions. We went over the weights for the different parts of the 
course. We went over how to curve the course and calculate final grades for 
students. Basically, from here, I am taking control of the course and will be 
reaching out to the department heads when I need help or guidance. 

After my meeting, I ate dinner and got to work. Here's my basic check list of 
what needs to be accomplished. A lot of these things won't be done anytime soon
as they require other deadlines to occur.

**Comprehensive To-Do List** (as of 6/4)

- Update students on the current situation
- Finish grading projects 1 and 2
	- Project 1 can be done
	- Project 2 is due 6/7 and will be graded after then
- Transfer lab grades from zyBooks to BBLearn
	- Lab 8 can be done
	- Lab 9 is due 6/7 and will be done after that
		- Lab 9 also needs to be written down for students so they can do it
- Do a final run down of project, lecture, and lab grades
    - Is everything accounted for
	- Do all students have grades
- Final Exam
	- Categorize the final exam questions
	- Create the exam by pulling X questions from each category
	- Choose size of exam (# of Qs, Points per Q)
	- Post the exam 6/8
	- Create study guide
- Final Grades
	- Create the assignments in BBLearn and weighted columns
	- Create the Preliminary Final Grade column based on the weights
	  from the syllabus
	- Calculate the final letter grades based off final percentage grades (6/16)
	- Curve if need be

First thing I did with my night was to announce and update my students of the 
current situation. The department heads and I agreed it was best to not tell 
students that the professor had COVID-19. They are currently deciding the best 
way for students to be told about the professor will not be attending to the 
rest of the course. Currently, they are deliberating between the department 
emailing students, or me telling them. My announcement today was about the
project and lab grades and the structure of the final exam. I also did an absurd
amount of thanking them for their patience and cooperation. I feel bad for them.
I'm a mess and everything is chaotic, and my grade and education isn't on the 
line. Overall, everyone was receptive. Philly has been experiencing some storms
recently that have caused power outages. I gave some students extensions to get
work done. The most I can do is to be accommodating. I need them to accommodate 
me. I had to cancel my Friday office hours. This exam needs to be done ASAP so
they have time to take it.

From there I started checking stuff off my list. I started with the grade center
and getting it prepped. I put the columns in for the assignments for Week 9 that
the professor never got around to adding. I got all my weighted columns set up 
and Preliminary Final Grades prepped. I can't tell if it's working until all the 
grades are in on 6/16. I've got something to jump off of.

From there I started reading through the 265 prepared final exam questions. I'm
absurdly thankful the exam questions already exist. I don't think I'd be able to
prepare an exam from scratch this close to the deadline with everything else I'm
taking on. I read through all the questions and started to categorize them. I
managed to break them down into different categories based on topic or structure.
This took way too long and it was getting late. Once I finished that, I have a 
good idea of what the exam is on and what information to tell the students to 
study. I also emailed our tech manager about getting these questions into 
categories on BBLearn. Mine is currently set up on paper. 

The plan for the final is to have pools of questions where X questions from each
category are chosen at random for each student. This way we can allow students
to take different exams at a similar level. For example, let's say we have a pool
of 30 questions. There are 10 easy questions, 10 medium, 10 hard. Each student 
only gets 10 total questions; 5 from the easy pool, 3 medium, 2 hard. This allows
each student to get similar exams, but not the same. This helps prevent 
plagiarism. The exam will be open for a week and students have 2 hours from 
opening it to complete it. This allows students with full time jobs, families, or
in stressful situations to complete on their own time.

I got a lot done today. I also got my first email from the professor since 
Saturday. Very short email. She got released from the ICU today. Terrifying to 
know she's been in the ICU. I'm glad to know she's starting to recover. She
definitely won't be here for the rest of the course, but I'm starting to think
I have things under control. I've got awesome department heads, a great tech
manager, and a completely unrelated mentor professor who's been keeping me sane.
We're all in this together.

<h3 class="pi">Friday, June 5th</h3>

I was up til 5am working last night and writing, so I woke up around noon today.
This is much later than I would have preferred to wake up, but it's not like I
need to be anywhere physically.

I woke up to a few important emails. Two from the undergraduate department head.
She sent myself and the other TA a preparatory email that she would be emailing
the entire class on the status of the professor, and that we should keep what
illness she has under wraps. The second email was sent 10 minutes later to the
full class. From what I can tell, I think the students were prepared for the
professor to be gone for the remainder of the course, this was just the final
confirmation of their theories.

I also got an email from our tech manager regarding the exam. BBLearn is really
unintuitive and nearly impossible to use. I have 265 questions to work with. My
plan was to categorize these questions and then pull X amount of questions from
each category to create a fairly well weighted exam. However, BBLearn was really
not helpful in this. When I go to access the questions, there's no organization
or clear way to tell them apart. This makes organizing 265 similarly worded 
questions very hard to do. Apparently I was using the wrong type of grouping and 
pulling questions from the wrong spots to organize. The tech manager sent me 
some links and videos to aid me. No matter how I did it, nothing worked. I sent
him another email explaining the issue. No response yet, and the weekend is 
coming up. I need to get a plan for the final by the end of tomorrow so that it's
ready to be released Monday morning.

If this category issue isn't resolved, I need a new tactic for the final. I think
I'm not gonna be able to do my slick categories plan. I'm probably just going to 
have to give my students X questions total. This leads to a much less balanced 
exam, but I don't have the time to spend fighting BBLearn. I also need to sit down
and calculate point values for the exam, point values for questions, and how many
questions.

I also got a chance to write up a comprehensive study guide for the exam with all
the topics and types of questions students can come across. I want to give them
as much information as possible since the deadline is so soon.

I was really not thrilled about how little I got done for the final, so I spent 
some time getting grades in BBLearn. I went through zyBooks and transferred some
reading and lab grades over. Normally, we'd have a script for this and it would 
take only 10 minutes. However, the professor isn't doing things the normal way.
The labs are out of 500 points which then gets scaled down to 10. This normally
would only take a simple equation, but not all 500 points are required to get 
the 10 points, and there are certain ways that are required to get certain points.
It's really messy and requires me to do this all by hand. I would go through and 
figure out a way to write a script, but I really don't have that free time right
now. 

One of the things I'm starting to hear myself say too many times is "I would do
X if I had more time..." and "I would do X if I had to do this every week". It's
an interesting new perspective and I'm learning a lot about teaching.

<h3 class="pr">Saturday, June 6th</h3>

Another late night and another late morning. I woke up to an email from our
tech manager. He told me that he is very good at using BBLearn, and if I told
him what I wanted, he would do it for me. It only took him a few hours to do
what would've taken me the entire weekend. This means I could do the category
style final exam.

From there, I finished the final exam today, which both gave me a few gray hairs
and took a massive weight off my shoulders. I managed to finish the exam with 36
hours to spare before students start taking it. I consider that an achievement.
I'm actually ahead of schedule and finishing tasks a lot faster than I was 
anticipating.

Since I'm so far ahead of schedule, I added more office hours to make up for the
fact I cancelled so many this week. I added some tomorrow before their project is
due later that night. I also added some on Monday night. That is in addition to
my normal Wednesday/Friday hours. I wish I could have given them more blocks of 
time to meet with me before their project was due, but the final had to come first.
It's a much larger portion of their grade and requires a lot more work from me.

From here, I think the only action item for the next week is to finish the grading
I have to do. I'll have their projects, the lab grades to transfer, and then any
stragglers that never got graded.

<h3 class="po">Monday, June 8th</h3>

Yesterday was busy with chores around the apartment, so I didn't get a chance
to write about what happened.

These two days have been my most TA-like days. Yesterday and today I held my
rescheduled office hours. I didn't realize how much I missed that interaction
with the students.

I started and finished grading the final part of their first project. We 
originally had one week in between each part of project 1, however, that didn't
give us, the TAs, enough time to provide good feedback that the students could
learn from. We gave them two weeks to finish the first project and the amount
that they improved is really showing. I hope to see the same thing when I grade
their second project that was due last night.

Their final zyBooks assignment was also due last night, so I transferred those
grades over today. I'm very glad to be done with zyBooks for the term. It is not
my favorite teaching tool. 

Today the final exam I spent way too long stressing on was opened. I have not had
any students start it yet. They have a week to take it, so I'm not surprised no
one has started the exam on the first day it opens. 

The course is really in the home stretch here. It's so much more manageable than I
was expecting.

**Completed Tasks**

- Finish grading project 1
- Transfer zyBooks lab grades
- Release final exam

**To-Do List**

- Finish grading project 2
	- Wait for the few extensions to come in
- Do a final run down of project, lecture, and lab grades

<h3 class="py">Wednesday, June 10th</h3>

Due to personal reasons, I haven't gotten nearly enough grading done. I've been
trying to take a break and manage my stress. I'm actually fairly ahead of 
schedule, so I can afford this.

I've been holding office hours according to schedule. I've got more tonight. 
It's been nice to act as a TA for a bit, and not a professor.

So the professor I work for who is sick also has a second course. It's called 
CI-103, it's the third class in a project based sequence for freshmen. My friend
is the TA for the class. Today we got a chance to talk about how their course is 
going with her absence. Apparently, the graduate TA for the course stepped in as
the professor dealing with everything I'm doing. They don't have a final exam 
though. I just found it interesting how for a much lower level course, they have
a graduate student taking over. In a higher level course, they have an undergrad
student taking over. 

I've finally started grading their second projects today and started grading the
backlog. No one came to office hours today so I had that extra time.

**Completed Tasks**

- Started grading project 2 and backlog
- Held office hours regularly

**To-Do List**

- Finish grading project 2

<h3 class="pg">Thursday, June 11th</h3>

Currently, I am eating the best platter of chicken tenders and curly fries from
the pizza place down the street, because today I celebrate! Today I completed 
all of my assignment grading! I spoke with the other TA, and she has also 
completed her assignment grading. We are currently waiting for a few extensions
to come in, but all the massive amounts of grading is done! This is such an
accomplishment for the course and the fact we got it done so soon too!. Grades
aren't even due til Wednesday at noon. I am so proud of everyone this term.

Today I also sent an update email to the professor. I haven't heard from her in
over a week, I'm a little worried about her health situation. The last time I
heard from her, she was making a recovery. She was definitely not doing great 
earlier.

<h3 class="pb">Friday, June 12th</h3>

All good things must come to an end. I was looking forward to an easy weekend
before grades are due and I have to calculate final letter grades, however, it
can never be that easy.

I was cleaning up the backlog a bit today. I had some extensions come in today.
I found a student who had been absent for the first month of the course. They
had emailed the professor that they flew back to China where they live, and due
to the international travel, were immediately placed in a special quarantine 
hotel with bad WiFi. They were unable to access the course until recently when 
they were released. The professor, before going on sick leave, told us she would
handle this student. I decided to take a look at their recently submitted 
assignments. I was on the second assignment for the class when I saw the following
comment.

```java
//String after removing vowels: hll, wlcm t jv-w3schls blg
```

To me, that looks like the string they were testing with was "hello, welcome to
java-w3schools blog", which is a strange string to test with. Sure enough, I was
able to find this exact code on w3schools, a common "learn to code" website. I 
managed to find the first three assignments completely online in different places.
All their code was copied exactly. I only got through the first three assignments
before I decided I needed a break.

Now normally, plagiarism cases are fairly easy. TA finds plagiarism. TA tells 
professor. Professor writes report. Well, I am currently lacking the professor
aspect of the process. I compiled the assignments I have so far and the links to the
websites where the student grabbed the code and zipped it up. I emailed it off to
the department head and the undergraduate department head since they're the ones
I've been reporting to instead of a professor.

In better news, I heard back from the professor today. She's still in the hospital
recovering. Last I heard was over a week ago and she was just getting out of the 
ICU. The email was much more coherent than the last one. She said she's excited to
go home to finish recovery. Hopefully she'll be home soon. I'm glad to know she's 
alright.

**Completed Tasks**

- Finished grading the last of the extensions
- Found plagiarism

<h3 class="pp">Saturday, June 13th</h3>

I was planning a detox of caffeine this weekend given I finished my work early.
Sadly, due to the plagiarism case, I still had plenty of work to do, and no
caffeine to do it.

Today the main task was going through all their assignment and checking for
plagiarism. I only went through the assignments they submitted on BBLearn and not
zyBooks. There are an absurd amount of assignments on zyBooks and it would take 
an absurd amount of time to go through each one. Also, given the outcome of the
BBLearn assignments, it might not even be necessary to look through the zyBooks
assignments.

While I was Googling for assignments, I received an email from the undergraduate 
department head. I was CC'ed on the response to an email from the plagiarizing
student. The student wrote a very long email concerned about passing the course,
how they had a lot of 0s in for grades, how they don't have many assignment grades.
There was a large section about how they "put in so much work" and that we are
being "very unfair". This is actually an incredibly common argument from students
that plagiarize. I very frequently get the email that they put a lot of work into
an assignment and it's unfair to accuse them of academic dishonesty. We hadn't 
actually reached out to the student about their academic dishonesty yet, so I found
it very funny that we got the email as I was investigating the case. The undergrad
department head responded that she and the department head would be looking into
their grades and assignments given the suspects of academic dishonesty. I did not
respond and continued investigating. 

For the most part, finding the assignments and where the student copied from was 
incredibly simple. Most students default to Google for assignments. If you search
the right keywords, I find the same results the student does. Typically students
also don't look past the first few results. I also have the advantage that I have
what the student submitted. Half the time, you can copy and paste a unique line
of code into Google and find exactly what you're looking for. If that doesn't work,
it's also easy to copy and paste the assignment prompt to find what you're looking 
for. Thankfully, this student wasn't very smart with what they copied and it was
fairly simple to find most of it.

Of the 14 assignments that are submitted on BBLearn, totalling 32% of their final
grade, I was able to find 13 online. I found links with character for character,
their exact submission. The only assignment that they completed themselves was a
single lecture participation assignment; "List 5 Things You Expect To See On The
Final". I zipped it all up and sent it over to the department heads for review.
There's absolutely no way this can be considered anything except academic 
dishonesty.

**Completed Tasks**

- Finished investigating plagiarism

<h3 class="pi">Monday, June 15th</h3>

Final exams finished up last night. Everyone finished it up. I had three students
not take the exam, but all of them haven't been completing assignments for a 
while. It's common for students to drop off and stop completing assignments.
It's a little worrying, but there's not much I can do about it.

Now all the grades are in the computer, all that's left is for me to calculate 
curve. Since it's my first time doing a curve, I decided I'd just take the top 
score to 100, then add that many points to each grade. It ended up being a small
three point curve. That's just about enough to take students up a partial letter
grade. So an A- becomes an A. Then Bs become B+s. Fairly simple. I went through 
and tapped in all the grades. It really didn't take that long which was nice.

The one this I was wholly unprepared for was the amount of emails I'd get about
grades. Students are ready to debate every single point on every assignment. It
was probably one of the most stressful parts of this course. Just an absolute
onslaught of students debating every point on every assignment. There's just a 
certain point where you have to put on a poker face and say you've done all you
can. It's not my fault a student didn't listen to feedback on previous 
assignments. It's not my fault a student didn't prepare for the final exam. I
did all I could to help them. It's too late now.

Today I got an email from the professor. She's home! She still has pneumonia, 
but she's home and is cleared for two hours of work a day. I'm so glad she's 
doing better and home safely. This experience has been horrifying, but she's
back. I'm still gonna finish up the course so she can rest, but just to know
she's back puts me at so much ease.

I had to make a quick trip to my biological father's today to celebrate my little
brother's high school graduation. He's off to Penn State. I didn't get any 
emails while I was out, so I think that students have calmed down a bit, accepted
their grades, and I'm ready to tell the undergraduate department head to push
grades to the transcript center tomorrow.

The plagiarism case is gonna be a long one. I have no updates on it. It's in the
department head's hands now.

We're almost there. One more email to go. Then I can put this course to rest. I
can give myself a rest. Take a nap. Take care of myself more.

**Completed Tasks**

- Final Grades
	- Calculate the final letter grades based off final percentage grades
	- Curve the class 3 points

**To-Do List**

- Email undergraduate department head to push final grades


<h3 class="pr">Tuesday, June 16th</h3>

This is it, my final entry. Today I emailed the undergraduate department head and
told her I was done. The grades are ready to be pushed to the transcript center.
I have one student giving me a hard time about his grade. He's failed the class
but there's nothing more I can do. She's taking over the case. I also thanked her
for her guidance and support in navigating the rest of the course. It's finally
over though. We got through.

**Completed Tasks**

- Everything

**To-Do List**

- Relax

<h3 class="white">What I Learned</h3>

I personally believe the only reason we do things in life is to learn, grow, and
better ourselves. So what would be the point in moving forward if I can't learn
from this experience.

**Skills Acquired**

- Calculated curves
- Calculated final grades
- Taught lecturing to another TA
- Found more efficient ways of investigating plagiarism
- Decided the structure of the final

**Life Lessons**

- It's okay to be unprepared and ask for help
- It's better to ask for help than suffer on your own
- The only thing I needed to make decisions was confidence. Everyone was already
confident in my decisions. I just needed it from me
