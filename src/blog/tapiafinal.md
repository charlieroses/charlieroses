<h3 class="po" id="lb">Looking Back</h3>

I've been thinking a lot about how to do this post. This series of blogposts
have been my most structured. While I was tempted to write "it was fine" and
nothing else, I realized I couldn't let myself drop the ball like that when I've
been going so strong.

To start, let's think back. I start by asking myself, what was my goal in
attending this conference? Looking back, when I got the email from Drexel that
they'd be funding participation, I immediately responded. Why did I want to go
so much? I think because a week prior, the email about Grace Hopper funding had
gone out, and I really wanted to attend Grace Hopper. I was looking for an
experience like Grace Hopper, but not so female centered. Despite not knowing
who Richard Tapia is, or what the organization CMD-iT is, I was excited for a
full scope of diversity and intersectionality in computing hosted in part by the
ACM. Can I say I accomplished this goal? I don't know if I did. The conference
did offer important parts of diversity, but as a whole, I think there was a lot
missing. That's not to say I didn't gain anything from this experience. Which
leads me into the...

<h3 class="py" id="p">Positives</h3>

I feel like I've been very critical of this conference and it's lack of
representation. I did really enjoy a lot of things about it, and I want to make
sure I give that recognition.

<span class="py">**Disability Access :**</span>
When attending the Philly Trans Wellness Conference in 2018, I
noticed that almost every event had an ASL interpreter, which I was not used to
seeing. There were also many events at PTWC about disability, and events not
explicitly about disability frequently mentioned it. After attending that
conference and seeing how much disability access is overlooked, learning how
easy it is to not overlook it, and spending time surrounded by diverse disabled
people, my entire mentality changed. After leaving, I realized how much lacking
there was in the world. I had yet to see anything that was as accessible as PTWC
was. I was really happy to see how accessible Tapia was. There were ASL
interpreters or captioners at almost every event. People took the time to
describe their physical appearance on video. There were multiple events centered
around disability. It was really nice to see. It's really common for DEI in STEM
initiatives to overlook disabled people. Many of the "increasing diversity"
fellowships I've seen for graduate school don't include disabled people in their
descriptions. While I'm sure Tapia was far from perfect, I was happy to see the
level of accessibility that is painfully uncommon in daily life.

<span class="py">**Mental Health :**</span>
Maybe my standards were too low, but the fact that there was an event about
mental health blew my mind. Society is obsessed with this "grind mindset", where
you work yourself to burnout for as long as you live and failure to comply with
this "grindset" means you're a drain on society. This is seen in the limited
number of sick days that employees get. As someone who's had mental health
concerns my whole life, I'm really happy to see it brought up in the field of
computing. The one panel I attended covered information I already practice with
both myself and my students. Even though I already knew it, it was very
affirming to hear it from someone else.

<span class="py">**Networking :**</span>
Normally, I groan at the concept of networking. It always feels very superficial
and forced. I've never gone out of my way to "network" with a person or an
organization. However, I think I did successfully network with people here and
form connections. I met an older transgender man who has provided incredible
advice in a variety of topics. I was introduced to The Papaya Project, a group
of people I'd love to work with in the future. I was able to briefly meet and
get contact information for people I want to contact. I accidentally met many
conference chairs in events, and they heard some of my concerns about
representation. I also have the tools to reach out to people about graduate
school and find potential advisors. So while I hate the concept of networking,
it wasn't too bad here.

<span class="py">**Graduate School :**</span>
I wasn't expecting to gain so much regarding graduate school. I've been worried
about applications and funding and finding an advisor and even just getting
accepted. I was really shocked to find assistance in places I wasn't expecting.
This older transgender man I met earlier has given and continues to give me
great advice. I met the representative from CRA-WP who gave me her email to
contact her. While, I couldn't attend the RISC-V event, I read through the
description and realized that watching through the recording would not only
provide me with technical interest but I'd be able to find more people in labs
I'm interested in.

<span class="py">**Resources :**</span>
I gained so many resources. If you read through my posts about the conference, I
tried to include every link to as much information as I could.

<span class="py">**Improvement :**</span>
I've mentioned many times my issues with the representation (and I'm gonna do it
again soon). However, every single step of the way, my voice and concerns were
heard. People took the time to listen with intent and understanding. They did
what they could to improve the situation at hand. This wasn't just apparent in
the organizers, but also the attendees. Every time I shared an experience or
concern, people listened and learned. When attendees made mistakes, other
attendees corrected them, and they were appreciative of the corrections. It was
a very good place where growth was encouraged. While it wasn't perfect, there
were steps made to improve, which is a core value of mine.

<h3 class="pg" id="n">Negatives</h3>

I've been clear with my opinions thus far. When I say negatives here, I don't
mean things that were intentionally done wrong or malicious. I wanted to just
touch upon the things that were missed and overlooked, both at this conference
and in diversity initiatives in general.

<span class="pg">**Registration :**</span>
I covered this in the introduction, but registration really messed up the "what
is your gender identity" question. It also didn't ask for pronouns or name
pronunciation. These things also weren't included in the profiles in the
conference Pathable online portal. I wish I could read through the registration
again to see if there were other things they missed for when I write my email.

<span class="pg">**Pronouns :**</span>
I'm disappointed I had to remind the organizers to include pronouns and I'm
disappointed in how consistently I was the only member of the Zoom room with my
pronouns in my name. It's really something that's so simple and important. Even
beyond trans representation, gender is a cultural construct. In one culture, a
name may appear to be traditionally female while another culture may interpret
that name as traditionally male. Even then, names are not inherently gendered.
In the popular sitcom [Scrubs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/), the main
female character is named Dr. Elliot Reid. At one point in the show, she is made
fun of for having a "boys name". However, Elliot isn't a "boys name" because a
cisgender female uses it. In addition to this, I always like to mention that if
Harry Potter weren't so popular, most people would not be able to guess the
gender of someone named Hermione. With this in mind, there is no way to tell
someone's pronouns based on their name. There's also no way to guess someone's
pronouns based on their appearance. Cisgender women can have square faces and
short hair the way cisgender men traditionally do. Cisgender men can have soft
features and long hair the way cisgender women traditionally do. Different
cultures have different beauty traditions, and people may misinterpret them
based on their traditions. So pronouns are so important beyond transgender
representation, because even cisgender people can be misgendered. I firmly
believe that pronouns should be listed in every place your name is. At the end
of the day, pronouns are a part of speech. We learned them in elementary school
grammar lessons as _a word (such as I, he, she, you, it, we, or they) that is
used instead of a noun or noun phrase_ [^1]. People are nouns[^2]. Names are
proper nouns[^3]. Since you don't know the pronouns of someone based on name
alone, and pronouns are used in place of names, then pronouns should be listed
everywhere your name is, regardless of gender identity or stance on LGBTQ+
representation.

<span class="pg">**LGBTQ+ Representation :**</span>
The representation was really disappointing. There was only one panelist I saw
who used they/them pronouns and they didn't even talk about their identity.
While it's not required for people to give personal details publicly, it was
still disappointing that the only representation I had was so minimal. It was
in the mental health panel too. Gender identity and mental health are directly
connected, so it was disappointing to not see that brought up. There were no
other hosts or panelists in the events I attended who were openly LGBTQ+. Given
how pronouns were overlooked, I would be surprised if any of the conference
committee chairs were LGBTQ+. In addition to that, there were no events that
explicitly mentioned LGBTQ+ people. There was an absurd amount of events
including a whole category called "Birds of a Feather" which were support groups
for specific marginalized identities. There was nothing that explicitly
mentioned the LGBTQ+ community in either the title or description. I'm really
hoping that I just missed something. I think I'm going to reach out to other
attendees in case they saw something I missed. Even the general diversity events
though had minimal references to LGBTQ+ people. There were no organizations in
the best practices event that specialized in LGBTQ+ inclusion in STEM. The
organizations that I talked to there didn't even have LGBTQ+ initiatives within
their organizations. This is even more baffling to me when
[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), one of the fathers of
theoretical computer science which is the basis of our field, was tortured by
the British Government for being gay. They chemically castrated him using long
term hormone treatment as an alternative to prison. This torture caused a severe
decline of his mental health which led to his suicide two weeks before his 42nd
birthday. The British Government has since apologized and pardoned Turing, along
with all other gay men treated this way in their history. It's so disappointing
that this important piece of LGBTQ+ computing history isn't even mentioned at
the diversity in computing conference. He was so young and had already
accomplished so much. I can't imagine where our field would be now if he hadn't
been tortured to death for being gay.

<span class="pg">**Theology, Spirituality, and Religion :**</span>
Now I haven't talked about this at all I believe. I think that belief systems
are not respected enough in the STEM fields. There is this mentality I've
encountered frequently that since STEM is based around hard science, facts, and
logic it cannot coexist with belief systems and practices. Whether you believe
in one, none, or many higher powers does not affect your ability as a scientist.
Then when religion is accepted in the STEM fields, it's limited to just
Christianity. I was about to talk about my Jewish professor who used to be a
committee chair for a conference, but stepped down when they scheduled the
conference over Yom Kippur. When I went to check her LinkedIn to see what
conference this may have been, I then saw that Yom Kippur took place from sunset
on 9/15 to sunset on 9/16 this year. This conference was scheduled over Yom
Kippur. Yom Kippur is the most important holy day of the year in Judaism. It is
a time where Jewish people pray and reflect on their sins. This is practiced and
observed with a full day fast, taking time off of work, refraining from hobbies
and pleasures, and synagogue services. This conference was scheduled over this
holy time. I don't think a conference has ever been scheduled over Christmas. In
addition to this, Muslims face so much islamophobia in America, I would be
amazed if this didn't carry over to STEM. So in diversity initiative in general,
I'd like to see belief systems considered more.

<span class="pg">**The Arts :**</span>
This isn't an inherently bad thing since no group of people was overlooked or
forgotten, but I wish that the arts were more considered in diversity
initiatives, computing, and at this conference. To limit the computing mentality
to a hard "black and white" science removes the creativity involved. Computing
is an art. Our creative hobbies impact the way we think, compute, and contribute
to the field. Cecilia Aragon talked about her experience as an aerobatic pilot
and how that contributed to her research as a PhD. Weaving heavily influenced
the way computer programming originated[^4]. The combination of arts and
computing is so important and frequently overlooked.


<h3 class="pb" id="cw">In Conclusion / What's Next?</h3>

Moving forward, I have some emails to write to the organizers. At the very
least, I want to bring the issues of registration and the community data
collection form to their attention. With accurate data collection, we can see
how underrepresented the LGBTQ+ community is in computing, which can lead to
more resources in the future. Based on how the committee has responded to my
comments thus far, I'm optimistic.

At the end of it all, I'm glad I went. Given I have the time, money, and
ability, I'd be thrilled to go again next year.
