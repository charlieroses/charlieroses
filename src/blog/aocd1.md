# Advent Of Code 2021

It's that magical time of year when CS majors around the world ruin their sleep
schedules for the glorious pursuit of [golden stars ★]{.ay}. Thankfully, in my
pursuit of graduate school, I'm ahead of the game. My sleep schedule is already
ruined.

I know for a fact I won't have as much time for
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
as I'd like this year. With grad school apps being due the 15th and the fall
term finishing up, I probably won't have time to complete the daily challenges.
I have to make the difficult choice between getting a PhD and collecting
[golden stars ★]{.ay}.

Since I'm aware of my time limit, but still want to participate in the challenge
for my own self improvement, I figured I'd make a blog post today with my
Advent of Code statistics, then see where I am on Christmas.

This year, I'm saying goodbye to Python. It's C only from here on out. On Day 1,
I've already done light years better. I went from over an hour last year to six
minutes this year. So even if I don't complete more than Day 1, I'm happy.
