So replace the `[chunks]` with whatever information fits there. If you were
given their contact information from someone else, I like to CC the person that
referred me and then replace the `[Website]` part too. Something like:

> `[Referrer]` and I recently met and they suggested I contact you regarding
> `[Issue Overview]`.

With the `[Issue Overview]`, keep it short, simple, and relevant. If you're
facing discrimination from a professor, something like "Professor `[Name]`'s
behavior in class" is plenty. This is also a good subject line for the email.
Just something that's quick and relevant and opens up future communication. 

Then for an email signature, I use the following format:

> [Preferred Name]
>
> <br>
>
> [Full Name]
>
> [Pronouns]
>
> [Contact Information]
>
> [Relevant Title(s)/Information]

So mine is currently:

> Charlie
>
> <br>
>
> Charles Stuart
>
> He/They
>
> src322@drexel.edu
>
> BS Computer Science - Drexel University 2022
>
> Head Teaching Assistant - Drexel University
>
> Founding President/Student Advisor - Out In Stem (oSTEM) @ Drexel University

Your email signature tells people about you. So my full name is technically
Charles, but I would prefer for the person I'm contacting to call me Charlie.
Then additionally, my pronouns, so they know how to refer to me. You can see
my whole
[pronouns post](../20211020/intlpronounsday.html)
talking about pronouns and names. Then, contact information so people can
contact you. Some people include their cell phone number or office phone number,
fax number or office location. I don't like giving out my cell number to
students and I don't have an office, so I've only restated my email.

Then for `[Relevant Title(s)/Information]` and also in the email template,
`[Relevant Role]`. In the email signature, I've included the top three reasons
I'm writing an email. 1) I'm a student contacting my professor. 2) I'm a
teaching assistant contacting my student(s). 3) I'm doing LGBTQ+ activism work.
Then when I introduce myself in the email, I restate which title is the most
relevant. So if I'm contacting my professor, I'll just say "I'm Charlie and I'm
a computer science student in your class, CS-123." since that's the most
relevant information.
