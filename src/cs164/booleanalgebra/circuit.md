Throughout this guide, I used a Digital Logic Workbench to allow you to
interact with the adders. This workbench was developed by Kazuhiko
Arase. If you follow [this
link](https://kazuhikoarase.github.io/simcirjs/), you will be redirected
to his website. On his website there's a much larger tutorial on how to
use the workbench to it's full extent. Try and use this to practice
building a half adder and a full adder.
