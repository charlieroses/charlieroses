## Some History

While you will never need to know this for an exam, it's important to
know the origins of boolean algebra. Boolean algebra was named for
George Boole. George Boole is a man who is long dead now that has lots
of impacts on the field of computing. He wrote a fancy paper called *An
Investigation into the Laws of Thought*. To summarize, the paper focused
on how the brain uses a series of true and false statements in
combination to make decisions. Boolean algebra is the computation of
these combinations of statements.

## In English

Before we start doing boolean algebra, we should probably start with
learning about basic boolean expressions. A boolean statement is a
statement that is either true or false. "It is raining today" is a good
example. If it is raining, the statement is true. If it is not raining,
the statement is false. Computers really like boolean statements. If we
recall, computers evaluate binary. Binary has only two values, 0 and 1.
Booleans also only have two values, false and true. This means we can
really think of two states, On and Off, True and False, 1 and 0. This
means 0, false and off all correspond to the same state while 1, true
and on all correspond to the same state.

## In Math

While boolean algebra started as a thought process, there are a lot of
applications. The applications we focus on in computer science are
mathematical. This includes basic algebra, set theory and circuits. This
guide will mostly focus on circuits. However, I will talk about other
applications where applicable.
