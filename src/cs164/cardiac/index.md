This study guide is on the CARDIAC and the basics behind computers. The
CARDIAC is a computer made out of cardboard. Hence the name,
**Card**board **I**llustrative **A**id for **C**omputing. It was made in
1968 by Bell Labs. Below I added three links, one to a CARDIAC Simulator
created by Dr. Brian L Stuart, another CARDIAC explantation that goes
much more in-depth than this one does, and the original CARDIAC manual.
