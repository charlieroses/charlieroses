Now this is what most freshmen come into Computer Science programs
expecting. Most freshmen expect software development via programming.
When freshmen think of programming, they think of the verbose languages
that they are taught in AP Computer Science (I see you Java kids).
You've already learned about assembly and machine code with the CARDIAC,
so in this section, we'll be talking much more about verbose programming
languages and what's going on there.
