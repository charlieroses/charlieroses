# An Introduction to Computer Science

---

You've successfully navigated to my site. I call this site many things,
a textbook, a study guide, the course website. It's goal is to present
the material is a comprehensive written way. The lecture slides are
purposefully left bare to promote paying attention in lecture. However,
it's very easy to get lost in the information as lecture covers many
topics varying in complexity. In an effort to better explain the
material, this site was created. Also, yes, I am aware the CSS for this
site is not great. Please accept it and move on. I used to have much
more motivation to make the CSS nicer. Now I'm just tryna make this all
work.

## The Organization

The most accurate of the above terms that I like to use is textbook due
to its structure. I've organized this "textbook" into "chapters". The
chapters do not exactly follow the order of lectures. I chose the
grouping based on related material and how I felt would be the most
logical order of content.

As I continue teaching this course, I learn new ways to present the
material. I also use a variety of ways to present material on pages.
That includes text, images, embedded circuits, and practice problems. If
you have issues accessing any of this, please let me know. I will do my
best to fix it. I also understand that everyone has different styles of
learning, so I did my best to cover many different ways of explaining.
