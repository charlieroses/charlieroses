<p><em>Since January 2018</em></p>
<p>
This project encapsulates all the work I've put into the course
CS-164 : Introduction to Computer Science at Drexel University in my time as
Head Teaching Assistant. As I finish through my senior year and the Fall and
Winter courses finish up, I'll add everything to the archive and close this
massive chapter of my life. The archive will include:

<h3 id="devsite" class="pb">Dev Website</h3>
<p><em>Since February 2019</em></p>
<p><em>Bash, HTML, CSS</em></p>
<p>
My personal site found at <https://charlierose.dev> (yes this one you're on
right now). It feels a little cheap to include the website I build as an ongoing
project. However, I don't intend on taking it down, and everytime I want to
have new features, I need to implement them myself. So the site stays, no matter
how redundant it may be.
</p>
<p>
This started as a very basic site to expand my resume. I've now turned it into
more of a portfolio. As I've needed more, the site's turned into a little
challenge for me in how much I can replicate flashy responsive websites using
only Bash and static HTML.

<h3 id="pokemon" class="pg">Pokemon Card Website</h3>
<p><em>Since April 2019</em></p>
<p><em>Bash, Awk, HTML, CSS</em></p>
<p>
I've been collecting Pokemon cards since 2011ish. I've always had them lying
around. In middle school 2011/2012 is when I distinctly started getting a lot
and taking proper care of them. In 2018 I decided to finally find out how many
cards I had and their values. This started the many day long process of
organizing my cards into an Excel spreadsheet. This was convenient at the time.
In 2019, I transferred the spreadsheets to CSV files and built a site using
some nightmarish Python scripts and JavaScript functions. After getting out of
my little "web dev" phase, I decided to rebuild in 2020 using something more
sustainable and aligned with my goals.
<a class="pg" href="../blogposts/20200625/pokemon.html">[Blogpost About Rebuilding]</a>
</p>
<p>
Currently the site is hosted on GitHub pages and is comprised entirely of static
HTML generated by Bash and Awk scripts. All the cards are stored in plain text
CSV files. The CSV files act as a very basic relational database to store both
the card information and the sets they belong to.

<h3 id="glendagopher" class="py">Clippy, Glenda and Go-Gopher Earrings</h3>
<p><em>January 13th, 2022</em></p>
<p>
I mentioned with the <a class="py" href="#cardiacearrings">CARDIAC earrings</a> that I make so many
earrings, that it's not worth my time to post all of them. These are more
computer themed earrings though, so I figured I should.
</p>
<p>
Originally, I was just going to make
<a class="py" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Clippy</a> earrings, since it
would just be a paperclip glued to paper. Then my friend suggested I also make
<a class="py" href="https://9p.io/plan9/glenda.html">Glenda</a>
and the
<a class="py" href="https://go.dev/blog/gopher">Go Gopher</a>
in honor of
<a class="py" href="../research/index.html#ugthesis">my research on Plan 9</a>.
I also adore all of
<a class="py" href="https://www.instagram.com/reneefrench/">Renee French</a>'s
art, so I'm happy to make a pair of earrings featuring her characters.
</p>
<p>
Apparently people don't like Clippy too much, but I find him quite charming.
It's a similar type of nostalgic charm that the
<a class="py" href="../blogposts/20220112/riowallpaper.html">Windows XP Hills Wallpaper</a>
minesweeper, MS Paint, and the cascading cards in solitaire have. I wanna do
more projects incorporating these. The Clippy earrings were fun and easy to
make. It's just a
<a class="py" href="files/Earrings_ClippyBent.png">[bent paperclip]</a>
glued to a piece of paper with googley eyes. They look absolutely adorable.
</p>

<p>
<a class="py" href="files/Earrings_Glenda.png">[Glenda]</a>
and the
<a class="py" href="files/Earrings_GoGopher.png">[Gopher]</a>
required a bit more work. They were both made out of
<a class="py" href="files/Earrings_GGUnbake.png">[polymer clay]</a>.
The required sculpting and baking and I accidentally
<a class="py" href="files/Earrings_GGBurnt.png">[burnt]</a>
them.
This means I had to spend even more time
<a class="py" href="files/Earrings_GGPrime.png">[painting]</a>
them to cover up the burn marks. Getting an even textureless paint job requires
many watered down layers of acrylic paint. So it took a solid day of waiting for
paint to dry to cover the burns completely. I was able to assemble Glenda before
painting since she's much more uniformly colored than the Gopher. I baked the
extremities separately, then used <del>failed Clippys</del> broken paperclips to
<a class="py" href="files/Earrings_GopherApart.png">[connect]</a>
the pieces. So far, they've held together.

<h3 id="cardiacearrings" class="po">CARDIAC Earrings</h3>
<p><em>December 8th, 2021</em></p>
<p>
On the 7th, my 360 freshmen took their final exam. We then spent a little over
12 hours the next day grading the exams. On my way to exam grading I thought
about how I wish I had a pair of earrings for CS-164. During a 30 minute break,
I printed out the CARDIAC and made a pair of earrings. I normally wouldn't post
such a quick earrings project, but these are really cute.
</p>
<p>
I got the graphics for the computer from
<a class="po" href="https://www.instructables.com/CARDIAC-CARDboard-Illustrative-Aid-to-Computation-/">this Instructables post</a>
by
<a class="po" href="https://www.instructables.com/member/megardi/">megardi</a>.
I got the image for the manual from the
<a class="po" href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardiac.html">CS-164 material Dr. Stuart uses</a>.
The manual has three pages in it, the first is the assembly code for a running
sum and count. The second is the machine code for the same program. This is the
the code for the fifth lab in CS-164. The last page of the manual is just the
CPU diagram for the CARDIAC we teach in CS-164. This was a fun quick pair of
earrings that turned out absolutely adorable. I made a pair for myself and the
other TA who's graduating this year.

<h3 id="comfy" class="pr">Comfy</h3>
<p><em>April 14th and 15th, 2018 @ Philly CodeFest</em></p>
<p><em>HTML, CSS, Google Firebase, Google Maps APIs</em></p>
<p>
Winner of the <i>Google Best User Interface Prize</i>. Which is <i>awarded to the most
well-designed, most intuitive, and unique mobile interface that focuses on the
user experience.</i>
<a class="pr" href="https://drexel.edu/cci/stories/codefest-2018-winners/">[Article]</a>
</p>
<p>
PhillyCodefest is the annual hackathon Drexel's College of Computing and
Informatics (CCI) hosts. The theme in 2018 was "computing for social good". I
signed up to attend my freshmen year because I had never done a hackathon before
and wanted to try it out. I didn't have a team or an idea until a week before
the event. I was out with my friend helping him with an assignment. We decided
to go out to dinner at a restaurant he heard was good, so we put in a
reservation. When we got there, it was dark, tight, and loud. My friend is
autistic and I also have sensory issues. We quickly both checked in with each
other to make sure we'd be able to get through dinner. We were both fine, but we
wished we had known sooner what the restaurant would be like. In that moment, I
had my idea for the hackathon.
</p>
<p>
The goal behind Comfy was to create a crowd sourced review app focused around
accessibility. Users would be able to enter a location and provide information
about the general environment. Our goal was a combination between Yelp and
<a class="pr" href="www.doesthedogdie.com">www.doesthedogdie.com</a>. We included criteria like "smoker friendly",
"wheelchair accessible", "bright lights", and "loud music". We tried to choose
common triggers that affect both physical and mental disabilities. When we
presented these categories, we framed them in an objective "expect this" or
"don't expect this" instead of "this exists and that's a bad thing". For
example, Hard Rock Cafe wouldn't make sense if rock music wasn't playing while
you're dining. Hard Rock Cafe is an obvious example. Our goal was to provide to
provide clear expectations of places and experiences so disabled people can make
the best decisions for themselves.
</p>
<p>
Since we were building a web app centered around accessibility, we needed to
make sure our app was accessible too. We spent a large portion of the hackathon
researching how to make sites more accessible. We found dyslexia friendly fonts,
chose colors that were colorblind friendly, and added proper image alt text for
screen readers. It was for this initiative we won our award.
