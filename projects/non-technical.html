Typically this is a pair of earrings or a tshirt that I can finish in an hour one weekend. I accidentally started a new project that may take many weekends.</p>
<p>I've been getting a lot of those targeted ads for embroidered boots. Most of them are floral themed, some are astrology themed. They all cost more money than I'm willing to spend on a pair of shoes. I decided I could probably figure out how to make a pair for myself.</p>
<p>I found of Doc Marten canvas shoes for $6 at the thrift store and got started. I drew up designs, redyed the shoes to refresh the color, then when transferring the deigns onto the shoes, I realized I wasn't going to be able to get the effect I wanted. I found a different pair of boots I already had and decided to jump in there instead. I'll find a different project for the Docs. The boots are too thick to embroider as is. My plan is to create a &quot;cover&quot; then sew it on top of the boot. I'll make a proper write up when I'm done.</p>

These are more computer themed earrings though, so I figured I should.</p>
<p>Originally, I was just going to make <a class="pb" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Clippy</a> earrings, since it would just be a paperclip glued to paper. Then my friend suggested I also make <a class="pb" href="https://9p.io/plan9/glenda.html">Glenda</a> and the <a class="pb" href="https://go.dev/blog/gopher">Go Gopher</a> in honor of <a class="pb" href="#ugthesis">my research on Plan 9</a>. I also adore all of <a class="pb" href="https://www.instagram.com/reneefrench/">Renee French</a>'s art, so I'm happy to make a pair of earrings featuring her characters.</p>
<p>Apparently people don't like Clippy too much, but I find him quite charming. It's a similar type of nostalgic charm that the <a class="pb" href="../blogposts/20220112/riowallpaper.html">Windows XP Hills Wallpaper</a> minesweeper, MS Paint, and the cascading cards in solitaire have. I wanna do more projects incorporating these. The Clippy earrings were fun and easy to make. It's just a <a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_ClippyBent.png">[bent paperclip]</a> glued to a piece of paper with googley eyes. They look absolutely adorable.</p>
<p><a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_Clippy.png">[Clippy Earrings]</a></p>
<p><a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_Glenda.png">[Glenda]</a> and the <a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_GoGopher.png">[Gopher]</a> required a bit more work. They were both made out of <a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_GGUnbake.png">[polymer clay]</a>. The required sculpting and baking and I accidentally <a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_GGBurnt.png">[burnt]</a> them. This means I had to spend even more time <a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_GGPrime.png">[painting]</a> them to cover up the burn marks. Getting an even textureless paint job requires many watered down layers of acrylic paint. So it took a solid day of waiting for paint to dry to cover the burns completely. I was able to assemble Glenda before painting since she's much more uniformly colored than the Gopher. I baked the extremities separately, then used <del>failed Clippys</del> broken paperclips to <a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_GopherApart.png">[connect]</a> the pieces. So far, they've held together.</p>
<p>Glenda and the Go Gopher Earrings: <a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_GG.png">[A]</a> <a class="pb" href="files/Earrings_GGSit.png">[B]</a></p><hr><h3 id="cardiacearrings" class="pg">CARDIAC Earrings</h3><p><em>December 8th, 2021</em></p><p>On the 7th, my 360 freshmen took their final exam. We then spent a little over 12 hours the next day grading the exams. On my way to exam grading I thought about how I wish I had a pair of earrings for CS-164. During a 30 minute break, I printed out the CARDIAC and made a pair of earrings. I normally wouldn't post such a quick earrings project, but these are really cute.</p>
<p>I got the graphics for the computer from <a class="pg" href="https://www.instructables.com/CARDIAC-CARDboard-Illustrative-Aid-to-Computation-/">this Instructables post</a> by <a class="pg" href="https://www.instructables.com/member/megardi/">megardi</a>. I got the image for the manual from the <a class="pg" href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardiac.html">CS-164 material Dr. Stuart uses</a>. The manual has three pages in it, the first is the assembly code for a running sum and count. The second is the machine code for the same program. This is the the code for the fifth lab in CS-164. The last page of the manual is just the CPU diagram for the CARDIAC we teach in CS-164. This was a fun quick pair of earrings that turned out absolutely adorable. I made a pair for myself and the other TA who's graduating this year.</p>
