Typically this is a pair of earrings or a tshirt that I can finish in an hour one weekend. I accidentally started a new project that may take many weekends.</p>
<p>I've been getting a lot of those targeted ads for embroidered boots. Most of them are floral themed, some are astrology themed. They all cost more money than I'm willing to spend on a pair of shoes. I decided I could probably figure out how to make a pair for myself.</p>
<p>I found of Doc Marten canvas shoes for $6 at the thrift store and got started. I drew up designs, redyed the shoes to refresh the color, then when transferring the deigns onto the shoes, I realized I wasn't going to be able to get the effect I wanted. I found a different pair of boots I already had and decided to jump in there instead. I'll find a different project for the Docs. The boots are too thick to embroider as is. My plan is to create a &quot;cover&quot; then sew it on top of the boot. I'll make a proper write up when I'm done.</p>

</div><hr><h3 id="cardiacearrings" class="po">CARDIAC Earrings</h3><p>On the 7th, my 360 freshmen took their final exam. We then spent a little over 12 hours the next day grading the exams. On my way to exam grading I thought about how I wish I had a pair of earrings for CS-164. During a 30 minute break, I printed out the CARDIAC and made a pair of earrings. I normally wouldn't post such a quick earrings project, but these are really cute.</p>
<p>I got the graphics for the computer from <a class="po" href="https://www.instructables.com/CARDIAC-CARDboard-Illustrative-Aid-to-Computation-/">this Instructables post</a> by <a class="po" href="https://www.instructables.com/member/megardi/">megardi</a>. I got the image for the manual from the <a class="po" href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardiac.html">CS-164 material Dr. Stuart uses</a>. The manual has three pages in it, the first is the assembly code for a running sum and count. The second is the machine code for the same program. This is the the code for the fifth lab in CS-164. The last page of the manual is just the CPU diagram for the CARDIAC we teach in CS-164. This was a fun quick pair of earrings that turned out absolutely adorable. I made a pair for myself and the other TA who's graduating this year.</p>
