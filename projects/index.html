The Pi has become an increasingly popular platform for Plan9. I spent the spring and summer doing miscellaneous minor projects to get comfortable with the operating system. This work transitioned into my undergraduate senior thesis in the fall. My thesis defense is scheduled for late May 2022.</p>
<p>Most recently, I've implemented interactive scaling wallpaper for <code>rio</code>, the windowing system for Plan9. I used the wallpaper support provided by <a class="pr" href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/rio.html">Devine Lu Linvega</a> as a starting point, then added scaling based on the window size and interaction with the <code>wctl</code> files to change the wallpaper while running. The code still needs to be cleaned up and I'd like to write proper documentation for it before posting it anywhere for others to use.</p>
<p>I've now transitioned this work to my undergraduate thesis. The Pi port of Plan9 does not support the use of the <a class="pr" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/">Raspberry Pi 7&quot; Touch Display</a>. The primary goal of my work is to get the screen working as a monitor. Once this is implemented, I'll be looking into the unique way the mouse and all three buttons are used in Plan9 in order to find the best way to implement the touch screen. While adding this functionality, I'll also be exploring the techniques used to write the operating system and implementing these values when writing my additions.</p>
<p>On December 10th, I successfully proposed my thesis to my committee. I wrote a more comprehensive blog post about the proposal experience. They didn't require me to write up a formal proposal document. I did present a <a class="pr" href="files/proposal.pdf">[slide deck]</a> of my initial research and literature review for about an hour. I did the slides based on the Plan 9 editor, acme, in Google Docs. I really like how they came out, so I'm working on making a proper beamer template for them. I'm almost finished and I'll post it when I'm done.</p>

As I finish through my senior year and the Fall and Winter courses finish up, I'll add everything to the archive and close this massive chapter of my life. The archive will include:</p>

It feels a little cheap to include the website I build as an ongoing project. However, I don't intend on taking it down, and everytime I want to have new features, I need to implement them myself. So the site stays, no matter how redundant it may be.</p>
<p>This started as a very basic site to expand my resume. I've now turned it into more of a portfolio. As I've needed more, the site's turned into a little challenge for me in how much I can replicate flashy responsive websites using only Bash and static HTML. <a class="py" href="https://github.com/charlieroses/dev-website">[Code]</a></p><hr><h3 id="pokemon" class="pg">Pokemon Card Website</h3><p><em>Since April 2019</em></p><p><em>Bash, Awk, HTML, CSS</em></p><p>I've been collecting Pokemon cards since 2011ish. I've always had them lying around. In middle school 2011/2012 is when I distinctly started getting a lot and taking proper care of them. In 2018 I decided to finally find out how many cards I had and their values. This started the many day long process of organizing my cards into an Excel spreadsheet. This was convenient at the time. In 2019, I transferred the spreadsheets to CSV files and built a site using some nightmarish Python scripts and JavaScript functions. After getting out of my little &quot;web dev&quot; phase, I decided to rebuild in 2020 using something more sustainable and aligned with my goals. <a class="pg" href="../blogposts/20200625/pokemon.html">[Blogpost About Rebuilding]</a></p>
<p>Currently the site is hosted on GitHub pages and is comprised entirely of static HTML generated by Bash and Awk scripts. All the cards are stored in plain text CSV files. The CSV files act as a very basic relational database to store both the card information and the sets they belong to. <a class="pg" href="https://github.com/charlieroses/pokemoncards">[Code]</a> <a class="pg" href="https://pokemon.charlierose.dev">[Site]</a></p><hr><h3 id="boots" class="pb">Embroidered Boots</h3><p><em>Since November 2021</em></p><p>With the never ending stress of class work and buggy code, I like to have a completely unplugged project going through a school year that allows me to destress. Typically this is a pair of earrings or a tshirt that I can finish in an hour one weekend. I accidentally started a new project that may take many weekends.</p>
<p>I've been getting a lot of those targeted ads for embroidered boots. Most of them are floral themed, some are astrology themed. They all cost more money than I'm willing to spend on a pair of shoes. I decided I could probably figure out how to make a pair for myself.</p>
<p>I found of Doc Marten canvas shoes for $6 at the thrift store and got started. I drew up designs, redyed the shoes to refresh the color, then when transferring the deigns onto the shoes, I realized I wasn't going to be able to get the effect I wanted. I found a different pair of boots I already had and decided to jump in there instead. I'll find a different project for the Docs. The boots are too thick to embroider as is. My plan is to create a &quot;cover&quot; then sew it on top of the boot. I'll make a proper write up when I'm done.</p>
