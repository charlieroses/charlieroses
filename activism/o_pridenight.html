<h3 id="the-myth-about-testosterone" class="png">The Myth about Testosterone</h3>
<p>The levels of testosterone of cisgender men and women have statistical <span class="png">complete overlap</span></p>
<p>Cis men can have both <span class="png">higher and lower</span> testosterone levels than cis women</p>
<p>Until 2018, the testosterone cut off for female athletes was <span class="png">10nmol/L</span></p>
<p><span class="png">25%</span> of cis men naturally fall within this range</p>
<h3 id="cisgender-medical-advantages" class="pnk">Cisgender Medical Advantages</h3>
<p>Michael Phelps is a cisgender male and a decorated Olympic swimmer with:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% lower production of lactic acid</li>
<li>A disproportionate wingspan</li>
<li>Double jointed ankles</li>
</ul>
<p>Phelps has never had his ability to compete questioned despite his natural advantages.</p>
<h3 id="transphobia-hurts-black-women" class="pny">Transphobia Hurts Black Women</h3>
<p>Caster Semenya is a South African runner who is intersex</p>
<p>In order to be allowed to compete, she was forced to undergo <span class="pny">medical treatment</span> to reduce her <span class="pny">natural</span> testosterone levels</p>
<p>Cis women Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi are Nambian sprinters <span class="pny">falsely accused</span> of being trans and are now <span class="pny">unable to compete</span> due to their natural testosterone levels</p>
<h3 id="ask-yourself" class="pnb">Ask Yourself</h3>
<p>How much testosterone is in your body? Are you sure you're playing a sport as the &quot;correct&quot; gender?</p>
<p>Legislators in Florida passed the bill <span class="pnb">HB 1475</span> which allows routine genital inspections of <span class="pnb">high school students</span> to participate in school sports. Who do you trust to routinely inspect your genitals? What if it were your child?</p>
<p>Are you concerned about facing transphobia if <span class="pnb">you</span> do not look or act the way <span class="pnb">other people</span> think cis men and cis women should?</p>
