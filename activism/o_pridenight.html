<h3 class="png" id="the-myth-about-testosterone-">The Myth about Testosterone </h3>
<p>
The levels of testosterone of cisgender men and women have statistical
<span class="png">complete overlap</span>
</p>
<p>
Cis men can have both <span class="png">higher and lower</span> testosterone
levels than cis women
</p>
<p>
Until 2018, the testosterone cut off for female athletes was
<span class="png">10nmol/L</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="png">25%</span> of cis men naturally fall within this range
</p>
<h3 class="pnk" id="cisgender-medical-advantages-">Cisgender Medical Advantages </h3>
<p>
Michael Phelps is a cisgender male and a decorated Olympic swimmer with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
50% lower production of lactic acid
</li>
<li>
A disproportionate wingspan
</li>
<li>
Double jointed ankles
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Phelps has never had his ability to compete questioned despite his natural
advantages.
</p>
<h3 class="pny" id="transphobia-hurts-black-women-">Transphobia Hurts Black Women </h3>
<p>
Caster Semenya is a South African runner who is intersex
</p>
<p>
In order to be allowed to compete, she was forced to undergo
<span class="pny">medical treatment</span> to reduce her
<span class="pny">natural</span> testosterone levels
</p>
<p>
Cis women Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi are Nambian sprinters
<span class="pny">falsely accused</span> of being trans and are now
<span class="pny">unable to compete</span> due to their natural testosterone
levels
</p>
<h3 class="pnb" id="ask-yourself-">Ask Yourself </h3>
<p>
How much testosterone is in your body? Are you sure you're playing a sport as
the "correct" gender?
</p>
<p>
Legislators in Florida passed the bill <span class="pnb">HB 1475</span> which
allows routine genital inspections of
<span class="pnb">high school students</span> to participate in school sports.
Who do you trust to routinely inspect your genitals? What if it were your child?
</p>
<p>
Are you concerned about facing transphobia if <span class="pnb">you</span> do
not look or act the way <span class="pnb">other people</span> think cis men and
cis women should?
</p>
