<p>Good evening students,</p>
<p>It was brought to my attention during this morning’s <em>Donuts with the Dean</em> that there are questions related to the single-use restroom on the 10th floor. This restroom, located near the advising offices, is currently closed due to a plumbing issue. Our team is actively working with building management to rectify the situation, but we unfortunately do not yet have a timeframe for reopening.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is a single-user restroom available on the first floor located at the rear of the drop-in lounge. Once the necessary repairs are completed on the 10th floor restroom, we will notify the CCI community. Once reopened, this restroom will be accessible to students who prefer not to use the gendered restrooms on the 9th, 10th, and 11th floors. To be clear, and as stated by University policy and local law, all individuals have the right to use the restroom that aligns with their gender identity and expression and I want to be sure that we do everything we can to help every member of our community feel secure and comfortable here at the College.</p>
<p>In acknowledging this larger issue of creating a safe and inclusive environment, I feel it is important to reiterate CCI’s commitment to fostering a space where all students, faculty, and professional staff feel safe and valued. We take diversity and inclusion very seriously and we will continue to explore ways to create the most welcoming and collaborative College possible.</p>
<p>I appreciate all of those who have taken the opportunity to bring forward their thoughts, ideas, and concerns. In particular, <em>Donuts with the Dean</em> is meant to be an open dialogue with students, but that dialogue is not restricted just to that event. I welcome your ideas at any time, and I do look forward to having many more constructive conversations and events in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Yi Deng</p>
