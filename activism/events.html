This years theme was <em>Embracing Identity Through Self Empowerment</em> and had four tracks: <em>Community &amp; Connection</em>, <em>Health &amp; Wellness</em>, <em>Learning &amp; Growth</em>, and <em>Art &amp; Expression</em>.</p>
<p>While the event lasted from January 21st through the 23rd, I hosted my workshop on Saturday, the 22nd. This was the first workshop I've ever hosted outside of Drexel and it was pretty exciting to put together. My workshop was titled <em>Accidental Activism in Academia</em> and was focused around my journey in starting my activism work and how to do it intentionally.</p>
<p>The slides, a workshop recording, and more information can be found <a class="pp" href="../blogposts/20220122/qwerhacks.html">here</a>.</p>
