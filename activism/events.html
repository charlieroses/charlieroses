This year the event is taking a hybrid format and will be hosted April 4th through April 9th. I don't think I'll have time to compete this year, but I might. It may be fun to go back after <a class="pp" href="../projects/previous.html#comfy">my team won in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Leading up to the hackathon, many student organizations and sponsors were invited to host workshops. I hosted a workshop on behalf of <a class="pp" href="ongoing.html#ostem">oSTEM</a> about building authentic diversity, not just sporting a rainbow logo in June.</p>
<p>Slides, recording, and breakdown in progress. It's finals week.</p><hr><h3 id="qwerhacks" class="pb">QWER Hacks @ UCLA 2022</h3><p><em>January 22nd, 2022 @ UCLA</em></p><p><a class="pb" href="https://www.qwerhacks.com/">QWER Hacks @ UCLA</a> is <a class="pb" href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking's (MLH)</a> first LGBTQIA+ hackathon. This years theme was <em>Embracing Identity Through Self Empowerment</em> and had four tracks: <em>Community &amp; Connection</em>, <em>Health &amp; Wellness</em>, <em>Learning &amp; Growth</em>, and <em>Art &amp; Expression</em>.</p>
<p>While the event lasted from January 21st through the 23rd, I hosted my workshop on Saturday, the 22nd. This was the first workshop I've ever hosted outside of Drexel and it was pretty exciting to put together. My workshop was titled <em>Accidental Activism in Academia</em> and was focused around my journey in starting my activism work and how to do it intentionally.</p>
<p>The slides, a workshop recording, and more information can be found <a class="pb" href="../blogposts/20220122/qwerhacks.html">here</a>.</p>
