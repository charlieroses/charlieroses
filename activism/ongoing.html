<p>This work started the moment I arrived at Drexel in the fall of my freshmen year. My teaching assistant for my introductory computer science course learned my legal name. He used it to refer to me instead &quot;Charlie&quot;, my actual name, because he found it funny how uncomfortable I was. After much hesitation, I reported the incident to the professor. That winter, I was hired as a teaching assistant. As a result of the incident, all teaching assistants were required to attend a workshop on respecting marginalized groups, specifically talking about the impact teaching assistants have on freshmen. This training had no information about the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. These events mark the start of my activism career at Drexel. I've included a timeline of major events along with resources, photos, and articles where applicable. It's a sort of scrapbook of my work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>September 2018</strong> : Unofficially founded <a class="pp" href="#ostem">oSTEM at Drexel University</a> under the Center for the Advancement of STEM Learning and Teaching Excellence (CASTLE) until getting officially recognized as a self governed student organization in Fall 2019.</li>
<li><strong>November 2018</strong> : Attended the <a class="pp" href="https://drexel.edu/hr/about/events/presawards/about/pastwinners/2018Winners/">2018 President's Award Ceremony</a> alongside CASTLE to accept the Award for Diversity &amp; Inclusive Community with them. <a class="pp" href="files/presidentsawards2018.jpg">[Photo]</a></li>
<li><strong>May 2019</strong> : Met with CCI Administration regarding the exclusivity of the Grace Hopper Celebration communications. Only students assigned female at birth were invited to attend the conference free of cost. This included transgender men and nonbinary students while also excluding transgender women from this opportunity. The issue was resolved. Now communication is sent to all students, regardless of gender. Female identifying students are encouraged to attend for their own support. Non-female identifying students are encouraged to attend to listen and learn in order to better support their peers.</li>
<li><strong>October 2020</strong> : Collaborated with the Society of Women Engineers in their annual <em>Lives and Lessons of the Underrepresented in STEM Conference</em> on behalf of oSTEM. I helped organize the event, was a panelist in the academia panel, and hosted an activity about identity.

<li><strong>February 2020</strong> : Publicly voiced the discrimination I face as an LGBTQ+ student to the Dean of CCI at a <em>Donuts with the Dean</em> event. The concerns addressed include the inaccessibility and safety of restrooms on campus, consistent dismissal of my identity by students, faculty, and staff, and the way the Dean ostracized me in the restroom. Previously the gender-neutral restrooms had been closed for many months due to plumbing issues. Within a week after the event, the bathroom was available for use again. [[College Wide Email from 2/12/2020]]</li>
<li><strong>October 2020</strong> : Collaborated with the Women in Computing Society (WiCS) student organization to host two events. The first was a basic transgender allyship workshop <a class="pp" href="files/wics2020training.pdf">[Slides]</a>. The second, I was a panelist in an event about the importance of sharing uncensored stories about being an LGBTQ+ individual</li>
<li><strong>May 2021</strong> : Invited to be a panelist for the Office of Equality and Diversity's (OED) event titled <em>Honoring Pride Month: A Frank Conversation About Gender and Sexuality</em>. <a class="pp" href="https://drexel.edu/now/archive/2021/May/Drexel-Celebrates-Pride-Month-2021/">[DrexelNOW Article]</a> <a class="pp" href="blogposts/20210602/oedpanel.html">[Blogpost]</a></li>

</ul><hr><h3 id="ostem" class="pb">oSTEM at Drexel University - Student Advisor</h3><p><em>Since February 2021</em></p><p>During my time as oSTEM's <a class="pb" href="previous.html#ostem_fp">Founding President</a>, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the organization folded. One of my dreams when becoming a council member for the CCI DEI Council in October 2020 was to rebuild oSTEM. However, I knew it wasn't realistic. The recognition process takes too long and I wouldn't have the bandwidth to act as president when we would have achieved recognition in my senior year. When the DEI Council was announced to the college, a student reached out to me about what they could do to get involved with LGBTQ+ DEI work at Drexel. I shared a few resources with them. Then, in February of 2021, a second unrelated student from a different class approached me asking about oSTEM and what events we were hosting. I told them that sadly, oSTEM had folded and we were not hosting events. The student asked what we'd need to do to rebuild oSTEM. After explaining the process, we set out to find a new executive board. I reached out to the student from the previous term. Within a few hours, the two of them had formed a new executive board to revive oSTEM.</p>
<p>Given I do not have the time to serve as president, but still want to be active in the organization, I've been acting as a student advisor to the group. Now that I've led the group through the recognition process, I've been working to connect the group to the resources I have available in addition to hosting an event here and there.</p>
