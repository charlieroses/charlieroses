<p><em>Drexel University's College of Computing and Informatics</em></p>
<p><em>Since July 2022</em></p>
<p>I'm currently working remotely as a coordinator for the CCI DEI Council I used to be a member of. I'm really excited to work here during my gap year and have the chance to continue the activism work I've done at Drexel in a formal position. In addition to planning events and initiatives, I have been working to create formal processes to streamline tasks that were originally handled manually by the council chair. This allows the council to work more effectively and provide more proactive programming.</p>
