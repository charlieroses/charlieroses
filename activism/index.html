<p><em>Drexel University's College of Computing and Informatics</em></p>
<p><em>Since July 2022</em></p>
<p>
I'm currently working remotely as a coordinator for the CCI DEI Council I used
to be a member of.
I'm really excited to work here during my gap year and have the chance to
continue the activism work I've done at Drexel in a formal position.
In addition to planning events and initiatives, I have been working to create
formal processes to streamline tasks that were originally handled manually by
the council chair.
This allows the council to work more effectively and provide more proactive
programming.

In October 2020, I became one of three undergraduate students on the inaugural

In this role I:
</p>
<ul>

Meet twice monthly with the council to discuss events, initiatives, and
college wide communications
</li>
<li>
Meet at least once monthly with Council Chair outside of council meetings to 
enact additional initiatives

for National Pride Month.
<ul>
<li>
Set up a table for the day in the CCI 10th floor lobby with
<a class="pg" href="../ccideitabling">informational flyers</a>

Raffled off three books about building a more affirming closet.

Many LGBTQ+ students use college as a chance to express themselves
authentically for the first time. This incredibly formative experience
can bring many unexpected challenges that other students already
learned much earlier in life such as wearing ties and applying make up.
This is also a challenge many first-generation college students face.
The flyers at the event aimed to provide students with this
assumed-to-be-common knowledge.

<p><em>Drexel University</em></p>
<p><em>September 2017 - June 2022</em></p>
<p>
This work started the moment I arrived at Drexel in the fall of my freshmen
year. My teaching assistant for my introductory computer science course learned
my legal name. He used it to refer to me instead "Charlie", my actual name,
because he found it funny how uncomfortable I was. After much hesitation, I
reported the incident to the professor. That winter, I was hired as a teaching
assistant. As a result of the incident, all teaching assistants were required to
attend a workshop on respecting marginalized groups, specifically talking about
the impact teaching assistants have on freshmen. This training had no
information about the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. These events mark the start of
my activism career at Drexel. I've included a timeline of major events along
with resources, photos, and articles where applicable. It's a sort of scrapbook
of my career and it makes me happy to read back on.

<b>May 2019</b> :
Met with CCI Administration regarding the exclusivity of the Grace Hopper
Celebration communications. Only students assigned female at birth were
invited to attend the conference free of cost.
This included transgender men and nonbinary students while also excluding
transgender women from this opportunity.
The issue was resolved.
Now communication is sent to all students, regardless of gender.
Female identifying students are encouraged to attend for their own support.
Non-female identifying students are encouraged to attend to listen and learn
in order to better support their peers.

<b>February 2020</b> :
Publicly voiced the discrimination I face as an LGBTQ+ student to the Dean
of CCI at a <i>Donuts with the Dean</i> event.
The concerns addressed include the inaccessibility and safety of restrooms
on campus, consistent dismissal of my identity by students, faculty, and
staff, and the way the Dean ostracized me in the restroom.
Previously the gender-neutral restrooms had been closed for many months due
to plumbing issues.
Within a week after the event, the bathroom was available for use again.

<p><em>March 17th, 2022 @ Drexel University's College of Computing and Informatics</em></p>
<p>
<a class="po" href="https://drexel.edu/cci/partnerships/community-engagement/philly-codefest/">Philly Codefest</a>
is Drexel's annual hackathon.
This year the event is taking a hybrid format and will be hosted April 4th
through April 9th. I don't think I'll have time to compete this year, but I
might. It may be fun to go back after
<a class="po" href="../projects/previous.html#comfy">my team won in 2018</a>.
</p>
<p>
Leading up to the hackathon, many student organizations and sponsors were
invited to host workshops. I hosted a workshop on behalf of
<a class="po" href="previous.html#ostem">oSTEM</a> about building authentic diversity, not just
sporting a rainbow logo in June.
</p>
<p>
Slides, recording, and breakdown in progress. It's finals week.

<p><em>January 22nd, 2022 @ UCLA</em></p>
<p>
<a class="pr" href="https://www.qwerhacks.com/">QWER Hacks @ UCLA</a>
is
<a class="pr" href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking's (MLH)</a>
first LGBTQIA+ hackathon. This years theme was <i>Embracing Identity Through Self
Empowerment</i> and had four tracks: <i>Community & Connection</i>, <i>Health & Wellness</i>,
<i>Learning & Growth</i>, and <i>Art & Expression</i>.
</p>
<p>
While the event lasted from January 21st through the 23rd, I hosted my workshop
on Saturday, the 22nd. This was the first workshop I've ever hosted outside of
Drexel and it was pretty exciting to put together. My workshop was titled
<i>Accidental Activism in Academia</i> and was focused around my journey in starting
my activism work and how to do it intentionally.

<h3 id="ostem" class="pi">oSTEM at Drexel University - Student Advisor</h3>
<p><em>February 2021 - June 2022</em></p>
<p>
During my time as oSTEM's
<a class="pi" href="previous.html#ostem_fp">Founding President</a>,
the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the organization folded.
One of my dreams when becoming a council member for the CCI DEI Council in
October 2020 was to rebuild oSTEM. However, I knew it wasn't realistic. The
recognition process takes too long and I wouldn't have the bandwidth to act as
president when we would have achieved recognition in my senior year. When the
DEI Council was announced to the college, a student reached out to me about what
they could do to get involved with LGBTQ+ DEI work at Drexel. I shared a few
resources with them. Then, in February of 2021, a second unrelated student from
a different class approached me asking about oSTEM and what events we were
hosting. I told them that sadly, oSTEM had folded and we were not hosting
events. The student asked what we'd need to do to rebuild oSTEM. After
explaining the process, we set out to find a new executive board. I reached out
to the student from the previous term. Within a few hours, the two of them had
formed a new executive board to revive oSTEM.
</p>
<p>
Given I do not have the time to serve as president, but still want to be active
in the organization, I've been acting as a student advisor to the group. Now
that I've led the group through the recognition process, I've been working to
connect the group to the resources I have available in addition to hosting an
event here and there.

<h3 id="ostem_fp" class="pp">oSTEM at Drexel University - Founding President</h3>
<p><em>September 2018 - May 2020</em></p>
<p>
I founded
<a class="pp" href="https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/drexelostem">oSTEM at Drexel University</a>
after facing transphobia from my teaching assistant my freshman year and being
unhappy with how the situation was addressed. It opened my eyes to the lack of
representation of the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. From this, I wanted to start a
student organization that mimicked the goals and success of the Women in
Computing Society (WiCS) student organization. From my research, I learned about
the
<a class="pp" href="https://ostem.org/">Out in STEM National Organization</a>.
</p>
<p>
Starting in the Winter of 2018 I spent about six months building our founding
executive board. Due to Drexel's timeline for student organizations, we were
unable to become a recognized self governed student organization until Fall of 2019.
We spent our first year operating out of the Center for the Advancement of
STEM Learning and Teaching Excellence (CASTLE), utilizing their resources to
host three events without recognition.
</p>
<p>
oSTEM at Drexel was operational as a
<a class="pp" href="https://drexel.edu/cci/stories/drexel-ostem-chapter-receives-recognition-from-national-society/">recognized student organization</a>
for approximately six months before the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine hit. The
entire executive board was faced with personal hardship. We were forced to step
back from the organization. oSTEM folded and lost recognition.
