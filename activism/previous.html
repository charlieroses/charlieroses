It opened my eyes to the lack of representation of the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. From this, I wanted to start a student organization that mimicked the goals and success of the Women in Computing Society (WiCS) student organization. From my research, I learned about the <a class="pp" href="https://ostem.org/">Out in STEM National Organization</a>.</p>
<p>Starting in the Winter of 2018 I spent about six months building our founding executive board. Due to Drexel's timeline for student organizations, we were unable to become a recognized self governed student organization until Fall of 2019. We spent our first year operating out of the Center for the Advancement of STEM Learning and Teaching Excellence (CASTLE), utilizing their resources to host three events without recognition.</p>
<p>oSTEM at Drexel was operational as a recognized student organization for approximately six months before the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine hit. The entire executive board was faced with personal hardship. We were forced to step back from the organization. oSTEM folded and lost recognition.</p>
