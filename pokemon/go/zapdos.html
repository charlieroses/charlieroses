Most max battle and raid guides typically only list the top
counters for each boss.
For raids, if you don't have any of the good counters, it's
less an issue because you can rejoin the battle and
<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/zerg-rush/">zerg rush</a> the boss.
For max battles where you only get 3 pokemon, it can be a bit
of a problem.
Strong Dynamax pokemon are also extremely expensive and some
have extremely limited availability, like Gigantamax Lapras
who was only available for 3 hours.
</p>
<p>
This guide lists out <em>every</em> available Dynamax Pokemon
and how they stack up against <span class="boss-name"></span> so that you can
build the best team possible based on the Pokemon and resources
that you have available.

<h3>Fast Moves in the Power Up Phase</h3>
<p>
The amount of damage done during the "Power Up" phase is negligible in G-Max Battles.
</p>
<p>
No single attack does enough damage to make a meaningful dent in the bosses HP.
This means they also don't do enough damage to charge the Max meter by more than the bare minimum.
Since all moves charge the max meter by the same amount, many quick weak attacks will be better
than one slow strong attack.
More attacks = more charge = more dynamaxing = more damage.
</p>
<h3>Fast Moves in the Dynamax Phase</h3>
<p>
The Max Attack used in the Dynamax phase is based on the type of the
Pokemon's Fast Move.
If you have a Gigantamax Pokemon, its first attack in each phase will be it's
unique G-Max Attack.
</p>
<p>
All Max Moves have the same power level based on their Max level, regardless of the fast move.
For example, Ember (10 power) and Incinerate (32 power) will both become Max
Flare during the Dynamax phase.
Level 1 Max Flare has a power level of 250 either way.
</p>
<p>
It's better to choose Max Attacks based on type effectiveness.
Against Dynamax Articuno, a Pokemon with Ember (10 power) will do more damage than a Pokemon
with Mud-Slap (19 power) because Max Flare is supereffective while Max Quake is not very
effective.
