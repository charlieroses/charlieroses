ESTM-201 is the first course in the sequence. I intended on completing the sequence before realizing teaching K-12 was not for me.</p>
<p>Weekly class sessions at Drexel were focused around creating lesson plans for elementary school students and how to handle classroom issues if they arose. In addition to this, Every other week we attended a class at Julia R Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School. Class sessions at Masterman alternated between observations and teaching. We'd first watch their teacher give a lesson, then, myself and two group members would teach a class from a lesson plan we had made. My group was assigned 5th grade math. The two class sessions we taught were about statistics and proportions. <a class="pp" href="files/dteach_poster.pdf">[Final Poster]</a></p>
