My Co-Op advisor reached out to me about the Philly Start Up Sprint so I applied and was accepted to attend.</p>
<p>I participated in the two week long online &quot;sprint&quot; designed to gain the skills and connections that would have been made in a typical summer internship. This included a variety of panels, networking events, Q&amp;A sessions, and trainings.</p>
<p>Through the sprint, we were broken into groups. My group was a team of seven other students from other colleges and majors. I don't think any two people in the group were from the same major. I think two people were from the same college, Penn State. We were given time limits to create pitches, presentations, and complete various projects. <a class="pp" href="https://github.com/charlieroses/PhillyStartupSprint2020">[Portfolio]</a></p>
