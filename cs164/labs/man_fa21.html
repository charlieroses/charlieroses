<h1 id="man-pages">Man Pages</h1>
<p>One of the things we’ve mentioned wanting to do but not having time to do is making <code>man</code> pages for Tranquility. We then realized this is a wonderful opportunity for you all to get more experience with <code>man</code> pages and documentation. For 5 points extra credit on Project 2, write a <code>man</code> page for your favorite built in function in Tranquility or for the Tranquility compiler.</p>
<p>Alongside your project 2 submission, submit a plain text file named <code>[function.txt]</code> where [function] is the function you wrote your <code>man</code> page about. Instead of a header with your name, user id, and lab section, use the <code>AUTHOR</code> section at the end of your <code>man</code> page. You may also use the formats listed in <code>man(7)</code>, but it’s not required.</p>

<h2 id="general-info">General Info</h2>
<p>Recall that in Question 5 on <a href="tuxlab_fa21.html">Lab 1</a>, we introduced a small selection of commands you may find yourself using frequently on Tux. Back in Week 1 when Tux, Unix, and the command line was brand new, this section was most likely very overwhelming and confusing. Now that we’ve spent a few weeks on Tux, let’s revisit this question with a new perspective. <em>Pro Tip: It’s always smart to revisit old material you struggled with, no matter how long it’s been since you last looked at it.</em></p>
<p>In Question 5, one of the commands we introduced was <code>man</code>. This command brings up the manual pages for other commands. By typing <code>man mkdir</code>, we get the manual page for <code>mkdir</code>. Go through some commands you use frequently and see if you understand their <code>man</code> pages now that you have a better grasp on Tux. Some <code>man</code> pages get quite hefty and overwhelming, but with practice, you’ll know how to find exactly what you’re looking for. Some commands with easy to read <code>man</code> pages include <code>mkdir</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>wc</code>.</p>
<p>Section 1 of the <code>man</code> pages contains the manuals for “Executable programs or shell commands”. Section 3 of the <code>man</code> pages contains the manuals for “Library calls (functions within program libraries)”. For those familiar with (or have heard of) the C Programming Language, you’ll be able to find the documentation for C in the third <code>man</code> section. This section will be the most useful when writing your <code>man</code> page. The following command brings up the <code>man</code> page for the C function <code>puts</code> which can be found in the third section:</p>
<pre><code>man 3 puts</code></pre>
<p>Some commands can be found in many sections. For example, <code>man</code> is found in both section 1, and section 7. Section 1 focuses on how to use the <code>man</code> utility, while section 7 focuses more on writing <code>man</code> pages. You’ll see these referenced to by <code>man(1)</code> and <code>man(7)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
<p>Given access to all the <code>man</code> pages on Tux and the Tranquility Programmers Manual, you should have everything you need to write an effective <code>man</code> page for your favorite Tranquility built-in function. If you can’t choose a favorite, try writing one for the <code>tranqc</code> compiler.</p>
<p>You may collaborate on the extra credit in ONE WAY ONLY. You are not allowed to collaborate when writing the <code>man</code> page, but you are allowed to collaborate to test them. These <code>man</code> pages are for you and your peers. If you’re worried about whether or not your <code>man</code> page is “good enough”, ask your peers to read it. “Hello [friend]. last week you struggled with [function]. This is what I wrote about [function]. Does this help clear up your confusion?” If your [friend] understands the material conveyed, then you’re doing a good job.</p>
<p>You will recieve credit based on how accurately you applied the standard <code>man</code> page formats and how accurate the information you provided is. If we think you did an exceptional job, we’ll include your <code>man</code> page in the Tranquility documentation we use in the future (with credit of course).</p>
<p>Submit a plain text document named <code>[function].txt</code> where [function] is the name of the function you wrote your <code>man</code> page about. For example, <code>tranqc.txt</code> or <code>setcellcolor.txt</code>. Instead of a header with your name, user id, and lab section, use the <code>AUTHOR</code> section at the end of your <code>man</code> page. You may also use the formats listed in <code>man(7)</code>, but it’s not required.</p>
