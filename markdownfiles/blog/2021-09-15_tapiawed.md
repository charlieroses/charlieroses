<h3 class="po" id="or">Opening Remarks</h3>

Due to an academic advising meeting I had today, I got to the conference late.
In the opening remarks and panel, I was happy to see an ASL interpreter. None
of the panelists had their pronouns in their Zoom names.

The panel was some technical talk about computing and the tech industry. I
wasn't too interested in the topics being covered. One thing that did stand out
to me was when a panelist stated something along the lines of "and that's what
we're doing about diversity. We need diverse people bringing their thoughts".
However, before stating that, the panelist was talking about her technical work
within the company as an engineer. She may have been talking about her ability
to be at the table and provide her diverse opinions and advancements. However,
the way she said diverse people sounded like she wasn't talking about herself.
Either way, she didn't really provide examples of what initiatives her company
had. Hopefully I was missing something.

At about 12:30pm, the organizers released a note: "Re: pro-nouns - the omission
is unintentional. Thanks for the reminder." The chat was set up so that you
could submit questions to panelists and only organizers could post messages to
everyone, so I don't know who and what comment this was exactly in response to.
I waited about 20 minutes for the panelists to acknowledge the pronoun omission.
I understand they were busy responding to questions, but there were many breaks
between questions to bring this up. I posed the question "Will the panelists
pronouns be listed anywhere?". Then 10 minutes later I got the following
response from the organizers "Regarding pronouns, thank you for bringing up
that. It is important so apologies for the oversight. We will encourage all
speakers to add their preferred pronouns." Then finally, 15 minutes later when
moving onto the audience questions, the moderator asked all the panelists to
give their pronouns. When given, they were said out loud, and not written down
anywhere. It's really disappointing how this was an oversight. This is a
conference about diversity. Things like presenters giving their pronouns is the
bare minimum in having a space where the LGBTQ+ community is included.

One of the final questions posed to the panelists was about having our voices
heard as underrepresented groups. The one panelist talked about how the most
important part of getting your voice heard is persevering. That many people
aren't trying to hold you down, they just don't know you're struggling to be
heard. That you just need to persevere and make sure your voice is heard. On
one hand, I agree that perseverance is the only way to get through. On the other
hand, I wish there was more acknowledgement on the toll that constant
perseverance takes on underrepresented groups. There is an added layer of effort
in just being heard. That constant extra effort is exhausting. So while
perseverance is necessary, it's also easier said than done.

<h3 class="py" id="ta">TAs For Inclusion</h3>

The first workshop I went to was titled **TAs For Inclusion: Creating a
Supportive and Diverse Community Through an Effective Teaching Assistants
Program**. The event was hosted by TAs and professors from Berea College. It was
also nice to see two familiar faces from Drexel also attending the event. One
being a professor I've TAed for before, the other being the professor in charge
of our TA program.

The set up of the workshop was a panel with the TAs hosting it, then breakout
rooms for analyzing situations, then a group discussion afterwards. To start,
the TAs introduced themselves. No one introduced their pronouns until I
mentioned something. I did like how they described their physical appearance. I
hadn't considered doing that before.

The panel was really good. I agreed with everything the TAs said. There was a
lot about the importance of diversity and inclusion in how it makes students
more comfortable to participate and ask questions and seek help. The most
important thing that stood out to me was the first question actually. The
question was "Why are you a TA?" It was really nice to see how happy the TAs
were when explaining why they do what they do. It was a good reminder of the
reason I enjoy this job. Especially online, you don't get many of the benefits
of TAing you normally would in person.

We then did breakout rooms for situation analysis. Before getting into what was
covered, I did wanna mention something unrelated. The one organizer who had
responded to my pronouns comment in the Opening Remarks was in my breakout room.
There were only three people there: myself, the organizer, and one of the TAs
moderating. He asked if I was the same Charlie who had mentioned pronouns
earlier and thanked me for bringing up the issue. He apologized about the fact
pronouns were overlooked and assured me that the Slack channels for the
conference management was addressing it. On one hand, I'm glad I've had this
impact. On the other hand, I wish I could just participate in this conference
and not have to remind the professionals to include me.

Back to the actual content of the breakout rooms. There were four rooms and
situations we could choose from. I chose the "Addressing Social Issues" room.
Our situation was about a student Maria who is an international student from
Venezuela. She's a bright student interested in technology. However, she's very
insecure about her abilities and struggles with asking for help. When she does
ask for help, she's very bright. When she falls into her insecurity and holds
back her questions, her grades suffer. How do we help her overcome this?

A lot of what we discussed was more observations and life lessons. We as TAs
need to make ourselves more human. We need to normalize not knowing everything
and making mistakes. We also need to recognize this "loud minority" of students
who boast how much they already know. It's very easy to fall into the trap of
comparing yourself to students who pretend they already know everything because
they have prior experience. It's important to recognize that we attend college
because we don't know everything. It would be a waste of time and money to take
classes on material you already know. We also talked about how, as an
international student, English may not be her first language. So while she may
understand the technical material, she may just be struggling with the language
barrier. This doesn't mean she's not smart or competent, it just means we have
to take extra steps to make sure our explanations aren't using language she
understands. In a more practical sense, we would suggest to her to attend office
hour time slots that aren't as busy. For example, when an assignment is due
Friday night, more students attend office hours on Friday than on Monday because
students love to procrastinate. Attending low volume office hours alleviates the
stress of asking questions in front of other students who may be judgemental.

We regrouped in the main session. We were a little rushed for time here, so we
didn't get to talk about all the situations in depth. The other situations were
about a student with time management issues, a student discriminating against
female peers, and a student concerned about their learning disability. One
attendee did state in the chat "Perfect is the enemy of done" and I think that's
a good quote to remember.


<h3 class="pg" id="gr">Leveraging Relations for Success in Graduate School</h3>

I got to this panel late. I think the TA workshop ended late. When I got to the
panel, all the panelists had their pronouns in their Zoom names.

The panel was titled **Leveraging Relationships for Success in Graduate School:
Identifying Barriers and Strategies to Navigate Faculty, Staff, and Peer
Relationships in Computing Graduate Programs**. I attended hoping to gain more
insight as I apply for graduate programs. The panel seemed to be geared more
towards people already in graduate programs looking to expand. The tips I did
get were:

- Reach out to advisors and labs with an interesting welcome email. Include
	references to their papers and work and why it matters to you and why you'd
	be a good fit in their labs
- Utilize pre-existing connections. Use these connections to talk to their
	connections
- Reach out to advisees in addition to advisors


<h3 class="pb" id="as">Assimilating to Belong in Computing</h3>

Then the final workshop I attended was titled **What Are Your Papayas?
Assimilating to Belong in Computing** hosted by
[The Papaya Project](https://the-papaya-project.github.io/).

This workshop was the perfect one to end my day with. The people hosting the
event had incredible energy. They were playing music as people entered and were
excited to host the event. It was still very professional, but a lot more
personal than the other events I attended.

When introducing themselves and their peers who couldn't attend, every person
included their name, pronouns, background, a physical description, and
acknowledged the land they were on. After their introductions they talked about
the importance of land and labor acknowledgements. This is the process of not
only stating where you live by its current name, but what indigenous groups this
land was stolen from. I live in the city of Philadelphia. This land originally
was inhabited by the Lenni Lenape people. The Lenni Lenape tribe was peaceful
and lived not just on, but with the land. For thousands of years, they kept the
land healthy as it did for them. During colonization, this land was stolen from
them and they had their cultures stripped from them. There have yet to be
reparations made to these indigenous tribes. In addition to the efforts of the
indigenous people to protect the land we're on today, we also acknowledged the
labor of slaves that went into tending to the land we're on. During the period
of slavery, people were stolen from their homes in other countries, had their
cultures and identities stripped from them, and were held hostage and forced to
work in America. We acknowledged that we would not be able to exist in the
capacity we do today without their stolen labor. By having these formal land and
labor acknowledgements, we start the process of providing reparations to these
groups that were harmed. While I personally am not responsible for colonization
and slavery, I still benefit from the stolen labor of enslaved people and the
quality of the land the indigenous people had stolen from them. We would not be
able to exist the way we do now without their exploitation. Land and labor
acknowledgements remind us that history has been sanitized for our comfort and
that we need to provide reparations to these groups that we exploited. To find
what traditional land you're inhabiting, you can visit
<https://native-land.ca/>. To find what slave labor went into where we are
today, you can visit <https://www.slavevoyages.org/>. I have a lot of respect
for the Papaya Project for being the first event I've been to that's brought
attention to these issues.

They didn't stop there. Before starting the content of the event, they discussed
the rules for our space. These rules are put in place to make sure people are
heard and respected.

- We are always **learning** and **growing**
- We speak from our **own** experiences (use I statements)
- We challenge the idea not the person
- We support one another
- We listen and make space for one another
- We bring our whole selves

They covered that this is not a teaching session, but a discussion to grow as a
group. We then recognized our personal responsibility over the power we hold. We
all hold power in many ways. We need to be mindful of this power and acknowledge
what we can do with it. We should be using our power to build and empower other
people. The person presenting this slide even said "I am cisgender which means I
hold more power than someone who is transgender". It was really nice to have
trans people mentioned without me having to bring it up first.

Now that we had established the rules for the space, we were able to start
having deep and effective conversations. They first talked about the symbol of
the papaya. Through colonization, the Filipino identity was whitened, both
literally and figuratively. Papaya products were used for skin lightening. This
caused issues of colorism, where Filipinos with lighter skin were more accepted
than Filipinos with darker skin. This promotes not only white beauty standards,
but that the only way to be accepted was to assimilate with these white colonist
ideals. We started with the following questions:

- What is our papaya?
	- How would you like to be treated in your space?
	- How often were you treated in the way you deserve?

The hosts started sharing their experiences while I typed mine in chat. When I
was done sharing in chat, I spoke out loud about my experiences being LGBTQ+ in
STEM. I started mostly that this question was difficult due to the phrasing
"your space". While I would like to talk about how I'm treated and how I want to
be treated in "my space", I have to have space to begin with. As a transgender
man, there is not normally space already made for me in computing. I have to
utilize diversity initiatives to get that space. Then, the issue, as seen at the
conference already, I have to frequently make space in the diversity initiatives
to be able to make space for me in computing. People were incredibly supportive,
thanked me for the work I do, thanked me for sharing my story, and also
acknowledged the effort that I have to expend to have space. Other people then
shared their stories. We then entered breakout rooms to have more in depth
discussions. I am not comfortable sharing other peoples stories, but I learned
so much from the other participants. This event by far was the one I was most
impressed with and gained the most from. These were the other questions we
discussed though.

- What are some values that you grew up with that you don't notice in CS?
	- What are the things that influence who you are and where does that fit in CS?
	- In what ways do you find/not find yourself belonging in CS?
- How can we do more than just survive?
	- What do we deserve for ourselves?
	- What do we deserve from our communities?
- What commitment can you make to yourself?
- What kind of commitments do you expect from your own spaces?

We ended with an anonymous post board of commitments we can make for ourselves.
The presenter also read out [Nope: A Manifesto](https://e-janestudio.tumblr.com/post/132335744305/i-am-not-an-identity-artist-just-because-i-am-a).
This event has been the highlight of the conference so far. I'm glad I attended.

<h3 class="pp" id="ct">Closing Thoughts</h3>

Today has been a roller coaster. We started off on a disappointing foot with
the first events, but The Papaya Project really turned it all around. 

I'm disappointed about the organizers overlooking LGBTQ+ inclusion. I am happy
that they were able to listen and quickly improve. I'm cautiously optimistic
about the rest of the conference. I am glad people are willing to listen and
learn. I hope I don't have to be the one to educate people.

I'm incredibly impressed with The Papaya Project and the space they created.
It's because of the space they created and the conversations they were able to
facilitate that have reminded me that there is space here for everyone.

The one thing I noticed is that workshop blocks overlap. There are workshops
that run from 4:45pm-6:00pm, but the next workshop block starts at 5:45pm. I
thought it was my own time management issues that I kept being late to events.
It doesn't make sense to me why they'd schedule things like that.

Then I also joined the Discord server for the conference. It's mainly being used
for networking. I saw in the "dei-general" channel someone asked for LGBTQ+ in
STEM resources for trainings. I responded I'd be interested in the same things.
These are the resources I have so far. I don't have time to look into them
tonight.

- [Out in STEM](https://www.ostem.org/)
- [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com/)
- [Out to Innovate](https://www.noglstp.org/)
- [ASEE Ally Training](https://lgbtq.asee.org/ally-training/)
- [Dylan Paré](https://dylanpare.com/)
- [The Queer Code Collective](https://queercode.org/)

I'm tired, but looking forward to tomorrow.
