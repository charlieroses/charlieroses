# QWER Hacks 2022 Workshop : Accidental Activism in Academia

[QWER Hacks @ UCLA](https://www.qwerhacks.com/)
is
[Major League Hacking's (MLH)](https://mlh.io/)
first LGBTQIA+ hackathon. This years theme was _Embracing Identity Through Self
Empowerment_ and had four tracks: _Community & Connection_, _Health & Wellness_,
_Learning & Growth_, and _Art & Expression_.

While the event lasted from January 21st through the 23rd, I hosted my workshop
on Saturday, the 22nd. This was the first workshop I've ever hosted outside of
Drexel and it was pretty exciting to put together. My workshop was titled
_Accidental Activism in Academia_ and was focused around my journey in starting
my activism work and how to do it intentionally.

I'm gonna spend this post going over my experience at the hackathon, creating my
first workshop outside of Drexel, and going more in depth than my slides allow.
The experience of planning the workshop, then hosting it, then creating this
write up has been so incredible and rewarding. I'm so thankful to the QWER Hacks
team for having me.

### Slides Breakdown

This is my first time hosting a workshop outside of Drexel, so I'm super
excited. I only have 30 minutes to host this workshop, so I needed to take the
time to focus, what do I want to cover, and how do I want to cover that?

I knew I wanted to cover my journey through activism and how to replicate that,
but I soon realized it was easier said than done. The first challenge was
figuring out what exactly I did. I didn't plan anything I've done at Drexel. It
just happened and snowballed and turned into the position I have today. So
first, I needed to figure out what I did, and how to replicate it. The second
challenge, once I figured out what exactly I wanted to present and what other
people could benefit from, was fitting it in the 30 minute time limit. I had to
cut a lot of content I wanted. Despite the cuts, I'm still happy with the
content I created.

I wanted to take the time to go over my slides and add material I didn't have
time to cover. I omitted a few slides from my explanation, but those slides
primarily covered logistics from the day of.

<div id="slide3">
![Slide 3: My Background](slide3.png)
</div>

I am currently in my senior year at Drexel University. Looking back, I could
have never predicted the path I would take here during my undergraduate
education. I have had such an influence on this college that I would never have
asked for. Now, I'm in a position where graduation is imminent and I need to
finish the work I can, or pass it onto someone else. This requires looking back
and figuring out what exactly I did. I took the time on this slide to identify
some of the most impactful events of my career as an activist at Drexel.

#### Closeted through High School {.qo}

High school Charlie would be quite disappointed in undergrad Charlie. High
school Charlie was an angsty teenager who wanted nothing to do with school and
would be truly disgusted to know how much undergraduate Charlie has done both
socially and academically. I really was an entirely different person. I was
closeted and afraid and wasn't fully aware of the gravity of what I was facing.
It wasn't until I started to come out in college that I realized what life could
be.

#### Starting College and "Coming Out" {.qo}

I put "come out" in quotes here. I realized in my first week at Drexel that no
one knew who I was and I took this time as an opportunity to reinvent myself. I
didn't tell anyone what my legal name was. I introduced myself as Charlie. After
my fall term, I decided to start using he/him pronouns and start correcting
people on my gender. This was the first time I really embraced my gender out
loud. However, I was still heavily closeted to both of my biological parents out
of fear, and rightly so and they both ended up being quite horrible, only
earning the title "parent" in the most biological sense.

#### Facing Transphobia From The Start {.qo}

I introduced myself exclusively as Charlie to others. I acted as if I had no
other name. However, my former legal name was used on class lists. This normally
wasn't an issue. I'd contact professors via email or after class to let them
know of the name change, and no one ever had any issues. Or, I'd just use only
my student ID for attendance and assignment purposes. In my first term, I took a
class called CI-101. It was a very basic class that just gave an overview of
topics that fell under the broad umbrella of "computing". For this reason, many
people skipped class and would have their friends sign them in for attendance
credit. We soon lost the privilege of signed ourselves in and the TAs were
forced to call attendance out loud everyday.

The first day that attendance was done out loud, our TA said "We have the wrong
list. There isn't an _former legal name_ in this class". My former legal last
name was at the start of the alphabet and I knew the TA was referring to me, but
didn't realize it. I raised my hand and corrected the TA, stating that despite
having the legal name called out, my name is Charlie. The TA took this
opportunity to exclusively call me by my legal name. He found it funny and would
laugh at the fact I was uncomfortable by this.

At first, I didn't do anything and I wasn't going to do anything. I only
reported the situation because my friends said I should. I told the professor
and he moved me to a separate lab with a different TA. The department also had
a sensitivity training for all the teaching assistants the next term, which
coincidentally included me. The training was focused around people of color and
women in STEM. I realized that the LGBTQ+ community was such a minority in STEM
that we weren't even being included as a marginalized group.

#### oSTEM @ Drexel {.qo}

I was inspired by the Women in Computing (WiCS) initiatives and their success
and I wanted to replicate that for the LGBTQ+ community. I realized that I could
count all the LGBTQ+ people I knew in the college on one hand and it was super
isolating. So I went and researched to see if there were any initiatives that
existed to build a stronger LGBTQ+ community in STEM. I came across
<span class="qo">[Out in STEM (oSTEM)](https://ostem.org/)</span> and
<span class="qo">[started a chapter at Drexel](../../activism/previous.html#ostem_fp)</span>

#### Donuts With The Dean {.qo}

After oSTEM, the work I was doing just snowballed. I kept finding new issues to
address, would assist in addressing them, which then unearthed even more places
to improve. One of my more larger actions actually had nothing to do with oSTEM.

As I mentioned prior, I came out very slowly in college. In addition to using
she/her pronouns for my first few weeks at school, I only used the women's
restroom in public. I was genuinely terrified to use the men's room. It wasn't
until my friend convinced me to start using the men's room with him. He would go
with me in the men's room and act as a layer of safety and protection. Later
that year, my friend graduated and
<span class="qo">[CCI](../../activism/#cci)</span>
moved to our new building.
In the move, we got a gender neutral restroom and I no longer had to fear using
the men's room alone. This quickly changed when our gender neutral restroom has
constant plumbing issues and was consistently closed. In the men's restroom, I
was always stared at by everyone. People would just stare at me with their jaw
open and this look of confusion or disgust on their faces. It was the type of
behavior I expected from students, however, I was also treated the same by
faculty, staff, and the Dean. I was fed up with the inaccessibility of the only
safe restroom in the building and the way that even the Dean was treating me. I
decided that in order to get through, I needed to bring up my concerns in a way
the Dean would understand. The Dean hosts an event "Donuts with the Dean". Here,
they serve free donuts and coffee and the Dean hosts a panel alongside the
department heads to answer student questions. At this panel, I publicly voiced
my concerns about the broken restroom and ended by stating that I felt unsafe
in the gendered restrooms based on the Dean's treatment of me. The Dean got the
message, sent out a
<span class="qo">[college wide email](../../activism/donutsdeanemail02122020.html)</span>
about the incident, and within a week, the bathroom was fixed.

#### DEI Council and Admin Work {.qo}

After the Donuts with the Dean situation, I started working with admin to not
just address the concerns I had, but to address any concerns within the college
and start creating systemic change. I started my
<span class="qo">[pronouns initiatives](../20211020/intlpronounsday.html)</span>
and an initiative to get menstrual waste bins in the men's restrooms (this one
is still in progress). I later joined the
<span class="qo">[CCI Diversity Equity and Inclusion Council](https://drexel.edu/cci/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-council/)</span>
and continued my work in admin.

<div id="slide4">
![Slide 4: A Overview of the Five Categories of Actions I've Defined](slide4.png)
</div>

In an effort to figure out how I went about this journey through activism, I
created these five "categories" of actions and environments. I figured that in
order to figure out how to deal with something, you first have to know what
you're dealing with. Also, in order to have progressive conversations, we need
the vocabulary to describe the situation and why it's a problem.

I tried my best to order these in terms of "severity" to show that you don't
fix discrimination with one massive swoop, but by progressing through step by
step. However, this image is probably more accurately drawn as a massive venn
diagram with millions of overlapping categories. These categories aren't meant
to be set in stone, they're just meant to provide descriptors to behaviors
you'll experience. An environment can exist with aspects of all 5 categories.
I've named the categories as follows, and the next five slides cover them more
in depth:

1. <span class="qy">[Actively Violent](#slide5)</span>
2. <span class="qy">[Passively Discriminatory](#slide6)</span>
3. <span class="qy">[Reactive Actions](#slide7)</span>
4. <span class="qy">[Preventative Actions](#slide8)</span>
5. <span class="qy">[Strengthening Actions](#slide9)</span>

---

<div id="slide5">
![Slide 5: An "Actively Violent" Environment](slide5.png)
</div>

An <span class="qg">**Actively Violent**</span> environment is one where it is
dangerous to be out. This is a place where hate crimes are rampant, encouraged,
or defended. Discrimination is explicit and blatant. It is clear that
marginalized groups are not welcome here because they are a marginalized group.
These include things like Jewish centers being vandalized with Nazi imagery or
Confederate flags, slavery, or Jim Crow imagery used to taunt Black students or
faculty. There is a strong effort to drive out marginalized groups.

This is a situation where you're not going to get very far with the university
administration. In this case, there needs to be outside intervention or a large
organized action. As one person though, the most important thing to do is to
protect each other. It's okay to remain closeted if it keeps you safe. You can
build a community while closeted. In an actively violent environment, it is a
powerful and radical act to form a small loving community.

---

<div id="slide6">
![Slide 6: A "Passively Discriminatory" Environment](slide6.png)
</div>

A <span class="qb">**Passively Discriminatory**</span> environment is a step
above "Actively Violent", but still not great. There still may be violent hate
crimes and prevalent discrimination. The difference is the action taken by
administration.

Administration with **acknowledge** actions. I want to highlight the use of the
word acknowledge, because I don't want to give more credit than is due. When I
say acknowledge, I mean the administration may make a statement, but the buck
stops there. Statements are to protect the college and to feign action. These
statements will typically be made only after an issue was made public and the
administration was under fire. These statements will typically not take a side
either and will condemn both or acknowledge good people on both sides. I will
say that issues aren't black and white and more complex than "good vs evil",
however, in the case of blatant discrimination where there is a clear attacker
and victim, there needs to be reparations.

In this environment, reparations aren't important. The optics is what matters
here. Any actions taken are only to improve the image of administration, not to
help a hurting community.

---

<div id="slide7">
![Slide 7: "Reactive Actions"](slide7.png)
</div>

Going a step further than acknowledging issues, administration can address
issues with <span class="qp">**Reactive Actions**</span> (I probably could've
chosen a less redundant name). These actions aren't horrible. Typically, these
are done by people who do care and do want to improve the situation and make
reparations. The issue is that these actions are only in reaction to issues that
happen.

Here, we'll see this cycle. There will be a "bad thing" that happens. This can
be hate crimes or discrimination or anything not great. A statement will be sent
out about how the community is in pain and how are taking action to fix this.
Then, unlike before, actions will actually be taken. The community will receive
the support it needs to heal and move past _this incident_. Attackers will be
punished and condemned. Then, the action stops. There are no further steps taken
to prevent things from happening again or to address other issues the community
is facing. Now, when a "bad thing" inevitably happens again, we have to start
all over, and this cycle continues. This cycle quickly becomes exhausting.

---

<div id="slide8">
![Slide 8: "Preventative Actions"](slide8.png)
</div>

We can expand on just reacting by taking
<span class="qr">**Preventative Actions**</span>. Once again, we are still
reacting to incidents as they happen, but now, we're trying to learn from the
discrimination that was experienced. We start to ask the following questions

- Why did this happen?
- What is the source of the issue?
- How can we prevent this from happening again?
- What will we do if this happens again?
- Can we apply this response to similar events?

Now our cycle looks different. Inevitably, discrimination will occur no matter
how safe an environment is. Once again, we will react to the discrimination and
take actions to address the immediate issue. Now, we won't stop when the issue
is "fixed". Instead, we'll ask the above questions and build resources to
prevent this from happening again. These can be educational resources or formal
processes or community supports. These are resources the community can use even
when there isn't an outstanding issue to be dealt with. As we utilize the
resources we built, we reevaluate them. Are they working? Do we need to
reevaluate our approach? When a "bad thing" happens, now we're prepared to
address it and we can make reparations faster.

Notice we still have this small cycle of using resources and reevaluating them.
This cycle is much less exhausting than a simply reactive cycle because we don't
have to start over so many times. There is no way to avoid a "cycle" when doing
activism work. As people and communities, we are always growing. The goal should
be not to remove a cycle, but create a cycle focused on growth.

---

<div id="slide9">
![Slide 9: "Strengthening Actions"](slide9.png)
</div>

<span class="qo">**Strengthening Actions**</span> are very similar to
preventative actions. The difference I want to make is that we're no longer
reacting to incidents anymore. Not only are we learning from discrimination, but
we're learning from marginalized groups and tackling larger systemic issues.

The largest part I want to point out here is that marginalized groups are at
_all_ tables and have a say in _all_ decision making processes. We are not just
using marginalized community members in "discrimination solving" situations. We
are also taking their opinions into account when we don't even think we have to.
Let's say a new building is being built on campus. Cisgender people may not
recognize the need to include a gender neutral restroom. Able bodied people may
not recognize an inaccessible environment. While the onus shouldn't always be
on marginalized groups to bring these issues to attention, it's hard to
recognize issues unless you've already been exposed to them.

Strengthening actions are different than preventative actions because we're
doing things we don't think we need to do. We aren't just addressing issues as
they occur, but we are building a safer and more inclusive environment, not
because we need to, but because we want to.

---

<div id="slide10">
![Slide 10: Asking "What Now?" and How to Move Forward](slide10.png)
</div>

Now that we have the vocabulary to describe the situations we're faced with, how
do we actually move forward and create change and progress?

#### Make a Formal Report {.qy}

When faced with discrimination or specific issues, it's best to make a formal
report for two reasons.

First, write down your story for your purposes. Most times, this is painful.
It's hard to recount events right after they happen, but this can be a very
important tool for trusting yourself. Recount events in as much detail with as
much proof as you have. Put this in a safe place. Given a situation where people
try to discredit you or gaslight you, refer to this and trust yourself. This
helps you protect yourself from issues being belittled or ignored.

Second, making a formal report with whatever office handles these situations
shows you are doing the right thing and you are doing what administration wants.
It's much harder to discredit you if you file reports through their offices. Get
receipts of these reports with dates and times. This adds a layer of
accountability to administration. If they intentionally trash your case, you
have further proof they're doing bad things.

The most important thing is to create a paper trail. If you have a phone call
with any office, take notes. Include dates, times, who you spoke to, and their
contact information. After the call, write an email thanking them for their time
and recapping the material covered. Actions like these add layers of
accountability to administration and add layers of protection to you.

#### Identify Trusted Individuals {.qy}

This step is less of a step, and more of an all encompassing bubble. Identify
people you trust and will work with you. This can be people in administration,
faculty, staff, students, friends, or family. You will always be able to find
at least one person to trust and support you, even if that one person is
yourself.

If you find trusted allies in administration, faculty, or staff, use their
resources. You are allowed to ask for support.


#### Identify a Chain of Command {.qy}

This is another "not exactly step one, two, three", but more an important thing
to do. You want to identify a "chain of command". In my freshman year, I had an
issue with a TA, so I went to the professor they work for. When I've had issues
with professors, I went to the department heads. If you had issues with the
department heads, contact the associate deans. Work your way up the chain of
command.

Almost all university employees have their roles and contact information posted
publicly on the university websites. Use these public directories and resources.


#### Write Emails, Have Meetings {.qy}

Once you know who to contact and how to contact them, it's time to write emails.
Here, I have a few general tips.

**Contact People, Not Offices** : Offices do not care about you. People care
about you. Find the contact information for the people in these offices and
talk to them directly. Offices have to enforce policies and power structures.
People are where change happens. Find the people and connect with the people.

**Use Their Website** : As before, almost all university contact information is
posted on websites. Use these contacts. Additionally, take the time to read
through any public university websites. Find their mission statements. Find
their values. When you're dealing with offices or uncaring people, throw these
back at them. These are their words that they were confident in and decided to
make them public. They need to uphold them.

**Set Up Meetings** : Start at email to make the connection, but the email
should be a lead in to setting up a face to face meeting. This can be online
over Zoom, or in person in an office. Either way, people will care more when
they're looking into the eyes of another person, not just reading words in an
email. Use this at time to truly connect.

**Be Nice** : This one is tough. Sometimes you have to be nice to people you
don't want to be nice to. Sometimes you have to be nice to people who aren't
nice to you. Sometimes you have to be nice to people who don't deserve nice
things. At the very least, you need to start nice. You need to be a person that
people want to care about. It's hard sometimes to find a balance between getting
justice and being considerate. You need to start nice though and make a good
impression to avoid being discredited. If they do try to discredit you and your
character, fight back.

I also wrote up an
<span class="qy">[Email Template](emailtemplate.html)</span>
that I tend to use when I'm contacting someone for the first time.

#### Make Noise {.qy}

This is the last option. This is where everything we've done has resulted in
nothing. At this point, we're no longer dealing with people, we're dealing with
structures, offices, figure heads, and politics. It's time to speak to the
power structure in the language they understand and hit them in a way they care.
This is where you hit them in the optics and the image. Bring your concerns to
donors and alumni. These are the lifelines of colleges. Make noise. Go public.
Force a response and force reparations. While this sounds aggressive, it doesn't
mean violence. Non-violent actions can include:

- Petitions
- Protests
- Public statements
- Contacting outside authorities
- Organizing large groups of students
- Attending donor and alumni events

It's important to be strategic and organized. You can't just be loud and angry
without going through the proper steps first. It may sound formal and annoying
and a waste of time, but at this point, the structures you are protesting are
going to do whatever they can to take away your credibility.

---

<div id="slide11">
![Slide 11: The Reality of the Situation](slide11.png)
</div>

I did want to address the sad truths, but also happy realities of what this work
is like. It's important to be realistic and understand what you're dealing with
while also being optimistic and hopeful. All of this is easier said than done
obviously.

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Marginalized groups need to do the majority of the work and it's exhausting</th>
<td>BUT</td>
<th>There is a massive supportive community that understands and is here to help</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

It's really tough to acknowledge the amount of work that marginalized groups
have to put in so we can have basic human rights. It's exhausting to always be
the "loud trans person" bringing up issues that no one was talking about.
However, there is a large community of other exhausted people and it's so much
easier and less exhausting to do the work together.

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<th>We can't end discrimination forever</th>
<td>BUT</td>
<th>We can end destructive cycles and replace them with healthier cycles built on growth</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

I've mentioned this many times already, but discrimination will always exist.
People will always exist who just hate me because I'm trans and they will
intentionally misgender me no matter what. Hate just exists sometimes. While I
don't have the power to stop individual people from hating me, I do have the
power to stop destructive cycles and educate the people around me.

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Looking forward, there's endless work we need to do</th>
<td>BUT</td>
<th>Looking backward, we've come so far in such a short period of time</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

This applies both to my specific journey through Drexel, but also to the LGBTQ+
community as a whole. It's hard to believe that same sex marriage was illegal
in the United States until 2015, only 7 years ago. The Stonewall Riots, which
are widely considered the beginning of the LGBTQ+ rights movement in the United
States, happened in 1969. Even though we have so far to go and trans rights are
constantly under attack, it's truly incredible how far we've come over the past
42 years.

---

<div id="slide12">
![Slide 12: How to Survive This Journey](slide12.png)
</div>

Finally, how do you get through this? How do you stay motivated when everything
sucks? How do you keep going?

It's so important to <span class="qb">**be loud**</span> and
<span class="qb">**be proud**</span>. It is what the LGBTQ+ community does best.
We've been doing it long before Stonewall, and we will continue to fight for
our existence. So hold onto that legacy and use it to carry yourself forward.

It can be exhausting being loud for so long, so remember to
<span class="qb">**be patient**</span>
but
<span class="qb">**be persistent**</span>.
Progress is often slow and painful. Slow progress is good progress. Just
remember to keep moving, even if you want to be going faster.

Always remember that it's not required to come out to be proud and be a member
of the LGBTQ+ community. It's important to
<span class="qb">**be safe**</span>
above anything else. Also, branching off of this, keep each other safe. I like
to always keep in mind that everything I do, all the energy I've expended is
worth it, as long as at least one person benefits and feels safer. This is a
massive part of
<span class="qb">**building community**</span>.
I mentioned this when talking about an
<span class="qb">[actively violent](#slide5)</span> environment, but many times,
the most radical act is building community and connections and loving each
other. It's easy to wish you were doing more, but it's enough to just build a
small tight community.

Then finally, some more concrete tips are to
<span class="qb">**save everything**</span>
and
<span class="qb">**self care**</span>.
The first time I mentioned "saving everything" it was in the context of making
a formal report. Also remember to save the good things. Part of building my
website was going through my phone and finding so many pictures from so many
important events and it made me so happy to find those pictures and look back on
them. So save everything that makes you happy and reminds you of how far you've
come and why the work is worth it.

Then self care is another "easier said than done". Take the time to let others
do the work or let others help you do the work or just take a break from the
work and do something for you. I've been repainting all the furniture in my room
this week and logging off my computer for hours at a time. It's been wonderful.

It's not an easy journey to do on purpose. It wasn't even easy to do
accidentally. The work is worth it though. The community is amazing and I'm very
thankful for it and I'm thankful that I got the chance to pass these lessons
onto others who care.
