# Philly Codefest Workshop : Building Authentic Diversity

[Philly Codefest](https://drexel.edu/cci/partnerships/community-engagement/philly-codefest/)
is Drexel's annual hackathon.
This year the event is taking a hybrid format and will be hosted April 4th
through April 9th. I don't think I'll have time to compete this year, but I
might. It may be fun to go back after
[my team won in 2018](../../projects/previous.html#comfy). I will be at the
event at the [oSTEM](ongoing.html#ostem) table.

Leading up to the hackathon, many student organizations and sponsors were
invited to host workshops. I hosted a workshop on behalf of oSTEM about building
authentic diversity, not just sporting a rainbow logo in June. The workshop was
hosted on March 17th, the week before finals week, so I've had a lot going on
that prevented me from posting my slides and breakdown.

I don't feel like I need to reintroduce myself on my own website, so instead I
just wanna share how good I am at making slide themes. I spent more hours than
I'd care to admit grabbing the Philly Codefest promotional materials and
photoshopping them to work as backgrounds and picking the right colors and
fonts. It was definitely worth it.

![Slide 4: What is Authentic Diversity?](slide04_whatis.png)
![Slide 5: What isn't Authentic Diversity?](slide05_whatisnt.png)
</div>

I had to think for a while about how to explain what I mean by "authentic
diversity". It's very easy to confuse performative diversity for diversity that
actually benefits marginalized groups. So instead of defining what authentic
diversity is, I decided to show was authentic diversity isn't using examples
most people would know.

There's two main "types" of performative/inauthentic diversity that I used:

- Type 1: [Not Harmful, But Not Helpful](#slide_6)
- Type 2: [Actually Harmful](#slide_7)


<div id="slide_6">
![Slide 6: Rainbow Logos in June](slide06_logos.png)
</div>

The first type of performative activism we'll see is almost everything that
happens during the month of June. June is National Pride Month in America which
is a great idea with poor execution.

At least here in Philly, everywhere you go there are rainbow storefronts and
pride themed products being sold and then there's a huge city wide pride parade.
Pride month is treated as a party month. On the surface, this looks great. When
you take a closer look, you realize that most of the floats in the parade are
corporations and the rainbows are barely skin deep. I remember my cisgender
heterosexual roommate one year being excited to attend Philly Pride, buying a
cute costume, and treating it almost like Coachella or some festival. Then once
I moved out, she started posting on Facebook about how dangerous gender neutral
restrooms are and the "transgender mindset" isn't safe for children. This is an
example of <span class="cfr">rainbow capitalism</span> where people try to
profit off of the more "digestable" parts of pride without fully supporting the
community.

Rainbow capitalism can be an entire presentation on its own, but to just show a
small example in my presentation, I'm using the way many companies will change
their logo to be rainbow for the month of June. This isn't something that is
actively harmful, but it isn't doing anything of value. It has a net 0 impact on
the LGBTQ+ community. Actions that would be meaningful here would be looking at
how LGBTQ+ employees are treated at these companies and if they have the health
care and resources they need. A rainbow logo with no other action is useless.

I do wanna mention the three companies I chose are completely random and I have
not done any research into the way they treat LGBTQ+ employees.

<div id="slide_7">
![Slide 7: JK Rowling is Homophobic](slide07_jkrowling.png)
</div>

The other type of performative activism is another form of rainbow capitalism
where we're using the LGBTQ+ community as profit while actively being homophobic
and transphobic. This is where we're marketing to the LGBTQ+ community in an
effort to hide homophobic actions.

A great example of this is
[J.K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling), the author of the
_Harry Potter_ book series. I chose her as an example because almost everyone
knows _Harry Potter_, but not many people know how horrible a person Rowling is.

In October of 2007, at Carnegie Hall, Rowling was asked a question about
Dumbledore, the headmaster at Hogwarts, love life. She answered that she
"always thought of Dumbledore as gay"[^1]. Despite this comment, there is no
written reference to his sexuality in the core seven books and eight movie
adaptations. Similar occurances are very common where a character will be
announced as LGBTQ+ despite there being no mentions of their sexuality on
screen. Other examples include LeFou in the live action "Beauty and the Beast"[^2]
and Gobber in "How To Train Your Dragon 2"[^3].

In her book, _Short Stories From Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous
Hobbies_ she writes:

> Lupin’s condition of lycanthropy was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry
> a stigma, like HIV and AIDS

She continues to explain how in the wizarding community, there is a lot of
discrimination based on the purity of blood, similar to the stigma regarding HIV
and AIDS and the character, Remus Lupin, gave her a chance to explore those
stigmas. This appears to be a very progressive stance, however, the only other
werewolf character we meet in the stories is Fenrir Greyback, the werewolf that
"turned" Lupin. In _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_ he is described as:

> Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards
> it as his mission in life to bite and to conta­minate as many people as
> possible; he wants to create enough were­wolves to overcome the wizards.
> Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback
> specialises in children... Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from
> their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards.

While Lupin is a character that is meant to explore and fight the stigma
regarding HIV and AIDS, the only other character we see directly enforces the
same homophobic stigmas.

Further reinforcing dangerous stereotypes, in _Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire_, Rowling introduces the character Rita Skeeter. She is a journalist known
for twisting facts for the sake of an interesting story and "goes out of her way
to cause trouble". She is described as having " blonde hair set in elaborate
curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face" and "large masculine
hands". Her physical description alone is a transphobic caricature of trans
women. Then it goes the extra step to reinforce more harmful stereotypes of the
transgender community.

If her written bigotry wasn't enough, Rowling proudly considers herself a TERF
(Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist)[^4] and writes crime novels under the
psuedonym "Robert Golbraith". There is a controverisal psychiatrist named
"Robert Golbraith Heath" who claimed to be able to "cure" gay men using
electroshock therapy.

I use Rowling as an example here to show how easily bigotry permeates pop
culture. Many people have read _Harry Potter_ and  adore the series. I want to
make it very clear that I don't think that people who like _Harry Potter_ are
bad people. It's important to be able to recognize the prejudice in Rowling's
work to prevent her prejudice from becoming your prejudice.

<div id="slide_8">
![Slide 8: What is Authentic Diversity?](slide04_whatis.png)
</div>

Now that we've seen examples of inauthentic diversity, we can look deeper at
what authentic diversity really means.

Authentic diversity is action that addressed the needs of a marginalized group
and breaks down systemic barriers.

<div id="slide_9">
![Slide 9: At CCI](slide09_atcci.png)
</div>

The examples I use here are from CCI purely because it's work that I spent a lot
of time on and I'm very proud of.

On the right, it's hard to see, but the
[CCI directories](https://drexel.edu/cci/about/directory/) include pronouns. The
[Cyber Learning Center website](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/clc/) we use for TAs
also includes pronouns. This was a part of a massive
[pronoun initiative](../20211020/intlpronounsday.html) that I spent well over a
year working on with CCI. This is something that seems small, but normalizes
pronoun usage. Everyone has pronouns and everyone uses pronouns. Most
transphobic people only have issues with pronouns when transgender people talk
about them. Publicly posting pronouns for cisgender people renormalizes the
"pronoun experience" for transgender people and makes it easier for trans
people to exist.
