# Advent of Code 2021

I mentioned in my
[day 1 post](../20211201/aocd1.html)
that I didn't know how long I'd last in Advent of Code this year. I want to
continue getting better at C and not rely on Python for the harder problems like
I did in past years. Sadly, I've got a lot going on at the moment, so I'm not
gonna try and convince myself that I have a chance of finishing. I'm gonna try
anyway, see how far I get and progessively add to this post. Then on December
25th, no matter where I'm at, I'll post it.

### Day 2 {,ag}

I don't know if these problems are easier than years past or if I've gotten more
competent. The navigation problem is a classic one. I probably could've shaved
at least a minute off my time if I had multiplied the depth and horizontal
distance from the start. I also forgot that `scanf` doesn't include spaces when
it grabs strings, which led to a slight bug I needed to fix. Either way, I
continue to do quite a bit better than years past.
