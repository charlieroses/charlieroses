# Advent of Code 2021

I mentioned in my
[day 1 post](../20211201/aocd1.html)
that I didn't know how long I'd last in Advent of Code this year. I want to
continue getting better at C and not rely on Python for the harder problems like
I did in past years. Sadly, I've got a lot going on at the moment, so I'm not
gonna try and convince myself that I have a chance of finishing. I'm gonna try
anyway, see how far I get and progessively add to this post. Then on December
25th, no matter where I'm at, I'll post it.

### Day 2 {.ag}

I don't know if these problems are easier than years past or if I've gotten more
competent. The navigation problem is a classic one. I probably could've shaved
at least a minute off my time if I had multiplied the depth and horizontal
distance from the start. I also forgot that `scanf` doesn't include spaces when
it grabs strings, which led to a slight bug I needed to fix. Either way, I
continue to do quite a bit better than years past.

### Day 3 {.ag}

I misread this problem SO MANY times. Spent too long debugging, realizing I had
misread the problem again, then restarting debugging. I also, in my speed code
writing frenzy, proceeded to forget everything I knew about binary, so that was
fun.

I did do better than last year in part 1, which I'm happy about. Part 2 is a
different story. I made the classic rookie mistake of not storing the input to
reference in part 2. I'll get better tomorrow.

If I do get through tomorrow, I will have completed an equal amount of
Advent of Code problems in C and Python. Then in two days, I'll be able to say
I've technically done the majority of Advent of Code in C.

### Day 4 {.ag}

Today was significantly more relaxing and enjoyable than yesterday. Debugging
was more straight forward, I didn't make silly mistakes. There was a BINGO
theme. It was a nice confidence boost after yesterday.

I have officially completed an equal number of challenges in C and Python. It's
been really nice to see how much I've improved since I've started.

### Language Stats {.ag}

This doesn't add up exactly. I can't find my 2018 solutions anywhere, then I
also did some days in both languages.
