#Philly Start Up Sprint [Week 2]

<h3 class="pr">Day 1</h3>

It's a brand new week and I'm already exhausted. Team Lombard is still in first
place! My team is great and we're having so much fun.

Today's topic was mostly marketing based. Lots of advertising, user interfaces,
user experience, graphic design, and branding. Personally, I was really looking
forward to UI/UX since that's a little more technical, but it ended up being 
about tricking consumers into spending more money. I really dislike this shady
aspect of business. Businesses that are in it for the sole purpose of making 
money and not actually bettering something or someone is just not my style and 
I prefer to stay out of that.

Anyway, today's group project was a very involved graphic design and marketing
challenge. We were given a prompt to have one company acquire another. We chose
to hypothetically have [Lyft](lyft.com) acquire [goPuff](gopuff.com). This 
combines the ridesharing with delivery service that can compete with 
[Uber](uber.com) and [UberEats](https://www.ubereats.com/). I was tasked with
creating a logo for the merger, and also an [Instagram](instagram.com) post to
advertise it.

If you look through my 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/charlierosec/PhillyStartupSprint2020) in
my Day06 directory, you can see the iterations and concepts I went through when
creating the logo and posts. I played with colors and alignment and language with
the logo. I ended up choosing the final logo with aspects of the Lyft pink and 
the goPuff blue. I played with different angles in the concept art. I tried to 
have the colors in our Instagram post match those from the logo but with a darker, 
nighttime mood. We chose Will Smith as a hypothetical ambassador. He and the goPuff 
fish are driving a Lyft car through Philly at night, making those late night 
snack deliveries.

We had a bit more time to work on our group projects this week. A little over 12
hours this time around. It was nice to have more time to put thought into our 
designs. I'm happy with what I made overnight. Overall, today I enjoyed the group
project a million times more than the many speakers.

<h3 class="po">Day 2</h3>

Due to the later due date, I don't know how Lombard is doing today. I hope we're 
still doing alright. Based on the amount of effort I put into graphic design
yesterday, I hope we're still winning.

Today is a great day for me! It's a technical day about Python. It was a really
simple introduction to `numpy` and `pandas` and using Python as a way to show
data manipulation. It was very quick. I spent the training answering questions in
the chat and going over basic syntax and explanations. The presenters were doing
a great job talking and I didn't want them to get overwhelmed with the chat. I 
know I tend to do so in lecture.

While I was really excited for Python and had an awesome time going through the
training, the rest of the day was severely disappointing. The group activity was
going to websites and playing around with the user interfaces. There was also a
random part of the group project about talking with other groups to share points.
Lombard street is probably gonna be kicked off our top spot, so that's annoying. 
I hate gross disgusting business tactics that have nothing to do with your ability
or what you learned. The afternoon speaker talked about finances. I really
dislike business and this really reminded me that. It's really a shame how that
played out.


<h3 class="py">Day 3</h3>

Due to the shady redistribution of points yesterday, Lombard was bumped down to
sixth place. I ended up speaking to the person in charge and he said the original
project was supposed to be in Python, but he got bored and chose the point game
instead. So that's horribly disappointing. Hopefully we can get our lead back.

Today was horribly boring. It's another advertising day. Today we talked about
targeted ads. I think the absolute worst quote from one of our speakers today
was "Businesses exist to get customers" which I think is backwards and gross.
I think businesses should exist to help people and not just extort them for
money. This advertising and marketing game is getting into that gross aspect of
using money to get more money that I'm not about. The group project was about
spending money on ads and stuff. It was really boring. I feel like we're really
drifting away from skills and just focusing on random money numbers and I hate
it.


<h3 class="pg">Day 4</h3>

I honestly can't say anything interesting happened today. We talked with some
people from [Campus Philly](https://campusphilly.org/) who talked to us about
what Philadelphia has to offer. As someone who's lived in Philly for the past
3 years, and lived outside of Philly for the other 18, I know my way around.
It felt a little touristy for me. 

Instead of a group project, we got out final prompt for our group project. It's
a massive project about creating a product and a company surrounding that item.
We had to prepare a slide deck with data visualizations, create a brand and 
logo and marketing plan. We had to plan out hiring. For the most part, one guy
in my group took the lead. He had an idea for a flashy Internet of Things (IOT)
smart coffee table that links to your phone and stuff. I'm an old fashioned CS
guy who wants nothing to do with all these smart home devices, so I was left to
graphic design. I'm not complaining.


<h3 class="pb">Day 5</h3>

It's the last day of the program. This morning, we finished up our presentation
and chose a presenter. The panel was about leaving Philadelphia to go work in a
different city, so as someone planning to go to grad school in Philadelphia, it
wasn't too interesting. Lombard Street did not win, somehow. They said out
presentation looked the best, but we didn't move onto the final rounds. You win
some you lose some.

<h3 class="pp">Final Thoughts</h3>

I am not a business major. I now know that as a fact. While I'm glad I participated
and got the chance to learn some skills, I would never attend something like this
in the future. I probably wouldn't have attended if I knew what I was getting into.
I feel like they did present some good aspects of business, but also, they tried to
gloss over some shady parts of business or make it look not shady. I'm not a fan of 
that. Overall, it was not my style. I'm a technical CS major at heart and it's good
to remember that. My largest takeaway was probably the way I applied CS problem 
solving skills to business problems. I wasn't bad at anything they threw at me, it
was just not interesting. Great job to kepler for putting this together.
