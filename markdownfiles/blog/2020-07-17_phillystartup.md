# Philly Start Up Sprint [Week 1]

Due to the global pandemic, I had lost my planned spring/summer internship as
the company froze hiring. I applied for a research position at Drexel instead.
This also fell through as it conflicted with my Teaching Assistant position. 
This whole time, my co-op advisor at Drexel had been sending me a variety of
random positions and opportunities that were opening up. Almost all of them 
did not fit my major. The bulk was actually Social Media and Marketing positions
that I do not want. One opportunity was the Philly Start Up Sprint. It's a two
week long conference type experience that's meant to build the skills you would
have received in a summer internship. I applied and got in. So for the next two 
weeks, I'll be watching talks and learning about different topics. I figure I
might as well write about the experience here.

<h3 class="pr">Day 1</h3>

Today is day 1 of the Philly Startup Sprint. Today wasn't much a learning day, 
mostly informational for how this program is going to be run, what is expected
of us, and making sure we all had the required documentation. 

One of the large aspects of this program is participating in a group project. 
Today we got separated into our groups and had our first group exercise. My
group got into a Zoom video conferencing room, did some quick introductions and
did the few exercises. The exercises were centered around getting Slack, Zoom, 
and Google Drive set up. We then did a group Quizzo exercise and answered some
random questions. We had fun and I think the group bonded well.

Later we had a Q&A session with a software engineer and the Co-Founder of NICKL
Inc, Ted Economy. He talked about getting patents and applying an engineering
thought process to building a business. 

So far, this program seems more geared towards the business side of things. I 
don't have much experience in business, nor have I ever sought it out. Hopefully
this program gets me experience in something I normally wouldn't do.

<h3 class="po">Day 2</h3>

I will admit, after Day 1, I was really worried about this program. I was really
worried that I would be bored listening to talks for the full four hours each 
day. Today was much more immersive, I was a little stressed sometimes, but I 
actually came out of it feeling good.

The first part of the session was about data management using Google Sheets and
Excel. I've never properly used spreadsheets before, so this experience was 
really fun. I always knew spreadsheets were powerful, but I've always opted for
CSV files and Bash and Python scripts for data processing. I went through the 
tutorial talk with the all the other attendees, then we broke into our groups
for the group project.

The group project had three parts and we had an hour to do it. The first two
parts related to formatting data and getting information in a spreadsheet. The
third part was to create a two slide PowerPoint explaining the Excel function,
`vLookup`, to 3rd graders. Since I have the most teaching experience, I was
delegated part 3. I ended up making a cute slideshow about tables and 
[Minecraft](minecraft.net) touching upon the concepts of fetching data and computers 
maintaining that process. I wanna go back and complete parts A and B on my own for
the experience.

We had a Q&A session with Emily Foote, she does a lot of work in education and
accessibility. These two topics are incredibly important to me, but sadly I missed
the Q&A session because I was medicating my sick puppy.

I've had the incredible idea of creating a GitHub repository to store all the
projects I and my team do these next two weeks. I'd like a way to showcase the
skills I learn. I'll probably get that repository set up tonight.

In other news, my group is off to a great start. They've made the group projects
competitive and we're in first place based on participation and Quizzo. I'm
really excited.

<h3 class="py">Day 3</h3>

Another day, another sprint. Today's focus was data visualization and storytelling.
Before I get into today's content, my team is still in first place! We did awesome
on our Day 2 assignments. They used my [Minecraft](minecraft.net) slides as an
example on how well I explained the material, so I'm really happy about that. 

So today's training and exercises were about data visualization, storytelling, and
delivering a good presentation. After delivering many lectures, I've learned a lot
of this information already. The typical, clear data images, don't overcrowd slides
with text. There was also a great section about the best way to format graphs and
diagrams to make them easy to read.

Today's tasks had three parts, once again to be completed in an hour. 

In the first part, we were given a spreadsheet of revenue and costs for our company,
Pretzler, a pretzel flavored seltzer. Our company wasn't doing great, but we needed
to pitch it to investors with a three slide PowerPoint. I did mostly some thematic 
elements there.

In the second part, we were given five pretty, but ineffective graphics and had to
give constructive criticism on all of them. Myself and another teammate worked on
this one. We each wrote our own critiques separately, then combined our ideas for
the submission.

The last part was writing about a visualization from 
[r/DataIsBeautiful](reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful) on [Reddit](reddit.com). Two of
my teammates worked on this part, so I didn't get a chance to work on it. I'll 
probably do this part on my own too.

In other news, I finally built a 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/charlieroses/PhillyStartupSprint2020) 
to act as a portfolio of the work we're doing here. I'm really proud of the things
I've written and the presentations I've created so far. I hope we get more into 
tech things later, but I don't expect to.

<h3 class="pg">Day 4</h3>

Team Lombard Street sees our third day in a row on top! I'm really enjoying my
team members and the competitiveness and the projects.

Today, we really didn't have a comprehensive theme. The projects had to do about
writing emails and pitches. I was a lot more interested in the Q&A session today.
The Q&A session was with Nick Bayer, the CEO of Saxby's, a coffee shop on campus.
While I haven't cared too much for the speakers yet, as they've really only talked
about business and starting businesses and being entrepreneurs, I will admit, I
liked this guy. One of the things I noticed, he kept talking about diversity and 
how many female employees and BIPOC employees he had. Coming from a cisgender,
heterosexual, white, male CEO, this immediately set off alarms in my head. In the
chat I asked something along the lines of "You keep mentioning these numbers, but
what are you actually doing for your LGBTQ+, BIPOC, and female employees?" I didn't
expect my question to get chosen, but it was. He ended up answering the question
really nicely. He talked about the different trainings he has and what he tries to
do on the CEO level. One of the things he said really stood out to me. _"How can
we be opening the door for other people, when the people opening the doors have
these implicit biases"_. We had a good talk and I was really impressed with the 
things he said about implicit biases, privilege, and the constant learning that
comes with it all.

Even though this program is centered around business, I'm really starting to enjoy
the work I'm doing and the things I'm learning.

<h3 class="pb">Day 5</h3>

Today's the last day of the week. I'm definitely feeling a sense of burnout. Like
yesterday, today was another day centered less around training and more around
Q&A sessions about businesses and entrepreneurship. We did some quick activities
where we looked at an absurd amount of resumes and made changes. We then also
answered a few interview questions. It was a fun reminder that I'm gonna have to
look for a job at some point and we got some tips on hunting.

Next week looks like it has more trainings, so I'm excited for those. They've 
been more interesting than a business person talking about starting their own
business. Maybe I'm just too technical for that stuff. Anyway, somehow my team
is still winning. Everyday we sit down in our Zoom room and just joke around. It's
been fun. Here's to week 2.
