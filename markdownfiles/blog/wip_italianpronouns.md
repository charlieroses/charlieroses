# The Italian Language and Gender

I've been off and on with trying to learn Italian my whole life. My biological
paternal grandparents are the children of Italian immigrants. I was raised in
an incredibly tight Italian-American family. We visited their family in Italy
when I was young. My biological paternal grandparents do not speak any Italian,
but my biological mother took Italian classes in college, so she taught me
proper pronunciation growing up. I've been off and on Duolingo. I took ITAL-101
and ITAL-102 which are the only Italian classes Drexel currently has available.
Recently, I've been working much harder to learn Italian and currently have a
47 day streak on Duolingo, and spend time writing in Italian in my journal
every night. As a trans person, I've been thinking a lot about gender in the
language.

In Italian, all nouns are gendered and adjectives can be gendered to attach to
the noun. In my ITAL-102 course, we were talking about feelings and I said
"Sono stanco" (I'm tired). The professor responded, "Sei stanca" (You are tired)
to "correct" the ending from an "-o" to an "-a" since she thought I was a girl.
So I correctd her, "No, sono stanco perch&eacute; sono un ragazzo" (No, I am
tired because I am a boy). It got me thinking how gender nuetrality would exist
in the language.

### Structure of the Language

So there are a few things to first note how Italian is structured differently
than English. Let's cover the basic rules before we discuss how to bend them.

#### Gendered Nouns and Articles

The first major difference between Italian and English are gendered nouns and
adjectives. In English we have articles such as "a" and "the". These are used
in every situation regardless of gender. In Italian, the nouns have gender and
the articles are gendered to match. So see the table below:

| Italian    | English    | Article | Gender    |
|------------|------------|---------|-----------|
| il cane    | the dog    | il      | masculine |
| lo squalo  | the shark  | lo      | masculine |
| l'animale  | the animal | l'      | masculine |
| i gatti    | the cats   | i       | masculine |
| gli uomini | the men    | gli     | masculine |
| l'acqua    | the water  | l'      | feminine  |
| la borsa   | the bag    | la      | feminine  |
| le donne   | the women  | le      | feminine  |
| un uomo    | a man      | un      | masculine |
| una carota | a carrot   | una     | feminine  |

There's two parts that really matter here. First, in English, words like "dog"
and "shark" aren't gendered, in Italian, they are and that affects the article
used. Second, the article also affected by whether the noun is singular or
plural. So while in English, we can use "the" for both "the dog" and "the dogs",
in Italian, you have to use "il cane" and "i cani" respectively. The table below
shows that relation. There are a few more rules regarding which article is used
specifically, but I won't get into that.

| The/A Article | Singular        | Plural |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Feminine**  | la, l', una     | le     |
| **Masculine** | il, lo, l', un  | gli, i |

So this doesn't tend to be an issue with people. We typically do not use
articles to refer to people the way we do with objects. The most common cases
where we do refer to people with articles, we're typically using already
gendered words like "Give this to the man" or "She is the mother". There are
also cases where the word after the article isn't gendered such as "They are a
person" or "She is a doctor". We'll come back to this in a moment. First, I want
to quick cover how the concept also plays into preposistions to show how
prevalent gender is in the Italian language.

| In The        | Singular          | Plural     |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Feminine**  | nella, nell'      | nelle      |
| **Masculine** | nel, nello, nell' | negli, nei |

| On The        | Singular          | Plural     |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Feminine**  | sulla, sull'      | sulle      |
| **Masculine** | sul, sullo, sull' | sugli, sui |

| Some/Any      | Singular          | Plural     |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Feminine**  | della, dell'      | delle      |
| **Masculine** | del, dello, dell' | degli, dei |

| From The      | Singular          | Plural     |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Feminine**  | dalla, dall'      | dalle      |
| **Masculine** | dal, dallo, dall' | dagli, dei |

So where we would normally say "in the water" would be "nell'acqua" and "some
sugar" would be "dello zucchero". As stated above, while this isn't as relevant
when referring to people, it helps set some ground rules for the language, that
will be revisted later.


#### Gendered Nouns and Adjectives

Just like articles, adjectives are also attached to the noun by gender and
amount. So another table of examples.

| Italian            | English          | Gender    |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------|
| la camicia azzurra | the blue shirt   | feminine  |
| il vestito azzurro | the blue dress   | masculine |
| le camicie azzurre | the blue shirts  | feminine  |
| i vestiti azzurri  | the blue dresses | masculine |
| una donna normale  | a normal woman   | feminine  |
| un uomo normale    | a normal man     | masculine |
| donne normali      | normal women     | feminine  |
| uomini normali     | normal men       | masculine |
| il cane bianco     | a white dog      | masculine |

In Italian, the adjective comes after the noun and attaches to it using the
ending of the word. Above "azzurro" means blue which is a masculine word on its
own. As an adjective to describe something that is blue, the ending -o changes
to -a for feminine nouns. Above when referenceing multiple blue dresses, the
masculine -o ending becomes a plural masculine -i ending. When referring to
multiple blue shirts, the ending becomes a plural feminine -e ending. There's
also adjectives like "normale" which ends in a singular -e ending. This gets
applied to "donna" and "uomo" the same way despite the gender. Then the -e
becomes -i for plural nouns.
