# QWER Hacks 2022 Workshop : Accidental Activism in Academia

[QWER Hacks @ UCLA](https://www.qwerhacks.com/)
is
[Major League Hacking's (MLH)](https://mlh.io/)
first LGBTQIA+ hackathon. This years theme was _Embracing Identity Through Self
Empowerment_ and had four tracks: _Community & Connection_, _Health & Wellness_,
_Learning & Growth_, and _Art & Expression_.

While the event lasted from January 21st through the 23rd, I hosted my workshop
on Saturday, the 22nd. This was the first workshop I've ever hosted outside of
Drexel and it was pretty exciting to put together. My workshop was titled
_Accidental Activism in Academia_ and was focused around my journey in starting
my activism work and how to do it intentionally.

I'm gonna spend this post going over my experience at the hackathon, creating my
first workshop outside of Drexel, and going more in depth than my slides allow.

[Workshop Recording] Pending

[Slide Breakdown] Pending

I've been very busy this past week and I'm not fully done the slides breakdown.
They will be finished by the end of Sunday (1/23), but I wanted to get the slides
posted for people coming from my workshop looking for them even if the full
explanations aren't finished yet.

Additionally, I wanted to post this before the workshop, so a recording of the
workshop doesn't exist yet because it hasn't even happened yet. The slides
breakdown will be posted at the same time as the workshop recording.
