# How to Collect Information on Gender Identity

One benefit of the COVID-19 pandemic was that many conferences shifted to
virtual setups. This has allowed me to attend conferences that normally would be
in other states that I didn't have the time to travel to. So far I've only
attended the [Philly Trans Wellness Conference](www.addlink.com), but I also
plan on attending [Grace Hopper's Celebration of Women in Computing](www.addlink.com),
the [oSTEM National Conference](www.addlink.com), and the [ACM some Diversity somthing Conference](www.addlink.com).
I've also recently started the long agonizing process of applying for grad
schools. This had led to me filling out a concerning number of applications.
Applications almost always include a "Select your Gender" question that I rarely
seen done in a way that is accurate. As a result of my constant frustration,
I've decided I'll just write up a quick informational post.

### Background ?

So before we get into how to structure this question, let's think about our
goals. Why are you collecting informations? Are you trying to gain demographic
information about you community? Are you collecting information so you know how
to refer to and contact your community? What information is relevant to you?

If you just want to collect people's contact information, then is gender
identity even necessary to know? In the case it isn't, what is more important
and more relevant would be asking for people's pronouns


### What Not To Do

Let's start with probably the most common, but also most frustrating option.

```
[] Male
[] Female
[] Prefer Not To Say
```

Here, we include Male and Female, but no other genders. There's more than two
genders.

```
[] Male
[] Female
[] Other/Nonbinary/Third Gender
[] Prefer Not To Say
```

So this option looks better than the one above it because it gives the
appearance of being more inclusive, but now instead of a false gender binary,
we've created a false gender trinary. This is still very uninformative.



### What To Do

So knowing that gender identities are complex, and these labels are used more
as descriptors instead of boxes to fit into, we need to make sure people can
choose more than one option. This allows for people to accurately identify
themselves, which beyond being more inclusive, allows for more accurate data
collection.

```
How do you identify? Choose all that apply:

[] Cisgender
[] Transgender
[] Nonbinary
[] Male
[] Female
[] Two-Spirit
[] Intersex
[] Other (Please Specify) ______
[] Prefer Not To Say
```

So some things I've intentionally done here. 'Cisgender', 'Transgender', and
'Nonbinary' all come before 'Male' and 'Female'. I've done this specifically to
avoid the "Men and Transgender Men" issue and instead refocus to "Cisgender Men
and Transgender Men". By appending cisgender to male, it normalizes transgender
men as real men, and avoids considering cisgender men as the default men.

I've also included 'Two-Spirit' since it's a sacred Native American gender. I've
included 'Intersex' which is an identity regarding biological sex. From there,
there are, there's also 'Prefer Not To Say' for people who don't wish to
identify themselves in addition to an option to self identify.

As mentioned before, it's impossible to include every single gender label that
someone could identify with. By using multiple umbrella terms that people can
select multiple of, we can cover a larger selection of identities. We will never
have a completely accurate
