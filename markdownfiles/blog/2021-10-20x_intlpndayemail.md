Dear CCI Students,

Drexel CCI's Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council is excited to share that we
have launched an initiative offering the opportunity for faculty and
professional staff to add pronouns to their website profiles - one of many steps
towards fostering an inclusive community - in observance of
[International Pronouns Day](https://pronounsday.org/)
(today, October 20, 2021). Referring to people by the pronouns they determine
for themselves is basic to human dignity. Together, we can transform society to
celebrate peopleâ€™s multiple, intersecting identities.

**_[Watch a video](https://youtu.be/2Z3lfhOcq_0) of Drexel CCI student and
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council member Charlie Stuart (he/they) to learn
more about the importance of pronouns, what they are and how you can implement
them into your daily life._**

**October is LGBTQ+ History Month,** an annual month-long observance dedicated
to honoring the great figures who fought for change and paved the way. We
encourage you to learn more about the
[rich history online](https://lgbthistorymonth.com/)
and check out events happening near you. Learning and acknowledging history
allows us to create a better future. To get started, check out the history of
