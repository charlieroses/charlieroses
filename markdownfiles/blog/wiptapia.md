# CMD-IT/ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference 2021

One of the few benefits of the pandemic is the accessibility of conferences now.
Almost all conferences are being hosted online, which makes it much easier for
Drexel to fund students to attend since there's no travel. I am very lucky that
Drexel has funded my ability to attend the
[Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference](https://tapiaconference.cmd-it.org/)
hosted by [CMD-IT](https://cmd-it.org/) and the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/).
I'm super happy I get to attend this event because diversity in computing is a
huge part of my life, and I also have been considering an ACM membership, as I
plan to get my PhD in lower level computing. So as I have for past conferences,
I'll write a post about my experiences. I've been enjoying the process of
writing on my blog. I recently read through my [experience](2020-06-16_570.html)
TAing a grad course over the pandemic. So I'm gonna continue doing what I'm
doing. Also, the college is having a meeting afterwards between the attendees to
discuss our experiences, so I need to take notes.


<h3 class="pr">Registration</h3>

So I haven't even started the event yet, and I'm a little disappointed. When
registering, I was faced with the question no form can ever get right.

> **What is your gender identity?**
>
> - Female
> - Male
> - Non Binary
> - Gender Fluid
> - Prefer not to answer

I have an entire [separate blogpost]() about my opinions on this question and
how to do it accurately, but its really disappointing to see how poorly this was
done for a conference about diversity. So a quick run down of why this is bad.
1) You could only pick one option. 2) It treats gender identity still as a
category to fit into instead of something that exists and can be described with
given gender labels. 3) The options are extremely limited. You can go read my
[other blogpost]() for more information on how to do this right. It's clear
there was an attempt to be more inclusive, however its very surface level.
It looks like an attempt was made only to say they are inclusive, but everything
else shows there isn't a deeper understanding of the community.

Then after registration, there was a Community Data Collection survey done by
the ACM to "better understand the diversity and inclusion of the ACM community."
This survey included the question:

> **To which gender identity do you most identify?**
>
> - Prefer not to say
> - Female
> - Male
> - Non-Binary
> - Prefer to Self-Describe. Please Specify

So we've already done a much better job now. By using the words "most identify"
shows that the list is incomplete and people can use more than one term to
describe themselves. They included a box to self identify which makes up for the
fact only three gender identities were listed. Even though this is better than
the registration, there's so much more work to do. So I took this opportunity to
make good use of the "Prefer to Self-Describe" box and wrote the following.

> Transgender Man. Despite trying to understand the diversity and inclusion of
> the ACM community, this question doesn't accurately capture the diversity of
> gender identity. While you do include a Non-binary and self identify options,
> which are great starts, the rest of this question is not accurate to the way
> gender exists. Gender is a social and cultural constructs. Different cultures
> place different roles on each gender. For example, before being colonized and
> having their culture stripped from them, Native Americans and Indigenous
> people had more than two genders. One of which being someone who is
> two-spirit. These two-spirit people still exist. In a more personal example,
> I am a transgender man. While I could identify as male in this question, I
> feel it removes an important part of my identity. I do not identify with 
> cisgender men (men who were designated male at birth). My experience as a
> transgender man has impacted how I've grown as a person and has heavily
> impacted my experiences in the computing field. Despite the fact I am a man, I
> am frequently ostracized by cisgender men because I am transgender. In
> addition to this, I frequently identify with the non-binary identity. Despite
> identifying primarily as a man, I am comfortable with androgyny, femininity,
> and using they/them pronouns. I frequently consider myself a nonbinary man to

> descriptors such as "male", "female", "transgender", "cisgender", "nonbinary",
> "two-spirit", "intersex" in addition to options such as "Prefer to
> Self-Describe" and "Prefer not to say". This allows users to choose more than
> one descriptor for their identity, and leads to more accurate data collection,

So my "self described gender identity" ended up being a large paragraph about
gender and facing discrimination. Hopefully it wasn't all for nothing. Hopefully
someone reads my response and more resources become available to the community.

In my response I did mention the lack of events at the Tapia Conference for
LGBTQ+ people. Over the course of this five day conference, there are a total of
118 events, excluding networking sessions, breaks, ceremonies, and poster
presentations. There is one that mentions Gender Based Violence, but still does
not specific whether it includes LGBTQ+ people. There are no events that mention
LGBTQ+ people in the titles or descriptions. While I am disappointed, I'm gonna
try and stay optimistic that the general "diversity" events will be inclusive.
