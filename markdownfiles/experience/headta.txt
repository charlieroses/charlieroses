I was hired as a Teaching Assistant my freshmen year. I was the first student to
start TAing as a freshmen. I do not believe anyone else has started so early.
I instantly fell in love with teaching and have yet to stop.

As a standard Teaching Assistant, my responsibilities are fairly basic. I run
class specific labs alongside another TA with about 40 students. I host office
hours where students come for tutoring. Then, based on the professors direction,
I grade assignments.

As a Head Teaching Assistant (CS-164, CS-283, CS-570, CS-571) I was given
significantly more responsibilities. These include, but aren't limited to
managing grading among other TAs, lecturing, writing exams and assignments,
syllabus development, hosting exam review sessions, and plagiarism
investigations. In one rather unique situation, I was unexpectedly forced to take
[control of a graduate course when the professor got COVID-19](../blogposts/20200616/570.html).
and was in the hospital for the remainder of the term.
