Computer science is a relatively new subject in the K-12 setting. Due to this,
there's no standard curriculum. Other subjects require a certification for each
subject you teach. Computer science does not have this certification. This was
apparent in my time as a teaching assistant for freshmen level courses at
Drexel. I get a set of freshmen with a wide range of backgrounds and experience
levels in computer science. There are students who went to technical
specialization high schools who know most the material. There's the group of
students who took the AP Computer Science A exam. There's a separate group of
students who took the AP Computer Science Principles exam. There's a smaller
subset who took both. There's also the students who didn't have computer science
courses in their high school and are entirely self taught. There also are
students who don't have any computer science experience at all. It's a tough
balance to get everyone on the same pace.

In December 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Education
[announced](https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/Education-Details.aspx?newsid=1002)
the 7-12 computer science certification and exam was available. In preparation
for this, PaTTAN took a cohort of 30 high school educators through a week long
boot camp to prepare them for the Praxis exam. This cohort included a wide
variety of educators who were all put in charge of their school's computer
science courses. The most prepared participants were the math and physics
teachers. The least experienced participants included librarians, English,
Spanish, and art teachers. I was a teaching assistant at this boot camp along
with

from Drexel and Shippensburg universities.

At the CSforAllPA boot camp, we taught the cohort a variety of topics covered on
the Praxis exam. These included, but were not limited to, Java Programming,
Networking, Cybersecurity, and Graph Theory. In addition to teaching the cohort
these topics, we also talked about how you present the material in the 7-12
classroom. We are discussed the accessibility of computer science in schools.
Some schools can afford laptops to give away to all their students. Students in
many school districts do not have computers or Wi-Fi or internet access in their
homes.

After the boot camp ended, I continued working with PaTTAN to develop their
online course materials for the cohort to reference. Even though the boot camp
was in the Spring of 2019, we knew they would be unable to take the Praxis exam
for another year. The online course was created to reinforce everything we
covered and to introduce material we didn't have time to go in depth with. I
created the following course materials for the online Schoology Course.
