Philly Startup Sprint, Philadelphia, PA

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the world started shutting down, I was one of
many Drexel students who lost their planned Spring/Summer Co-Op. My Co-Op
advisor reached out to me about the Philly Start Up Sprint so I applied and was
accepted to attend.

I participated in the two week long online "sprint" designed to gain the skills
and connections that would have been made in a typical summer internship. This
included a variety of panels, networking events, Q&A sessions, and trainings.

Through the sprint, we were broken into groups. My group was a team of seven
other students from other colleges and majors. I don't think any two people in
the group were from the same major. I think two people were from the same
college, Penn State. We were given time limits to create pitches, presentations,
and complete various projects.
