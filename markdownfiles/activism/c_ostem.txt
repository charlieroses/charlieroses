One of my dreams when becoming a council member for the CCI DEI Council in
October 2020 was to rebuild oSTEM. However, I knew it wasn't realistic. The
recognition process takes too long and I wouldn't have the bandwidth to act as
president when we would have achieved recognition in my senior year. When the
DEI Council was announced to the college, a student reached out to me about what
they could do to get involved with LGBTQ+ DEI work at Drexel. I shared a few
resources with them. Then, in February of 2021, a second unrelated student from
a different class approached me asking about oSTEM and what events we were
hosting. I told them that sadly, oSTEM had folded and we were not hosting
events. The student asked what we'd need to do to rebuild oSTEM. After
explaining the process, we set out to find a new executive board. I reached out
to the student from the previous term. Within a few hours, the two of them had
formed a new executive board to revive oSTEM.

Given I do not have the time to serve as president, but still want to be active
in the organization, I've been acting as a student advisor to the group. Now
that I've led the group through the recognition process, I've been working to
connect the group to the resources I have available in addition to hosting an
event here and there.

I founded
[oSTEM at Drexel University](https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/drexelostem)
after facing transphobia from my teaching assistant my freshman year and being
unhappy with how the situation was addressed. It opened my eyes to the lack of
representation of the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. From this, I wanted to start a
student organization that mimicked the goals and success of the Women in
Computing Society (WiCS) student organization. From my research, I learned about
the
[Out in STEM National Organization](https://ostem.org/).

Starting in the Winter of 2018 I spent about six months building our founding
executive board. Due to Drexel's timeline for student organizations, we were
unable to become a recognized self governed student organization until Fall of
2019. We spent our first year operating out of the Center for the Advancement of
STEM Learning and Teaching Excellence (CASTLE), utilizing their resources to
host three events without recognition.

oSTEM at Drexel was operational as a recognized student organization for
approximately six months before the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine hit. The
entire executive board was faced with personal hardship. We were forced to step
back from the organization. oSTEM folded and lost recognition.
