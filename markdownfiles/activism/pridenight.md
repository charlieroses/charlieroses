### The Myth about Testosterone {.png}

The levels of testosterone of cisgender men and women have statistical
<span class="png">complete overlap</span>

Cis men can have both <span class="png">higher and lower</span> testosterone
levels than cis women

Until 2018, the testosterone cut off for female athletes was
<span class="png">10nmol/L</span>

<span class="png">25%</span> of cis men naturally fall within this range


### Cisgender Medical Advantages {.pnk}

Michael Phelps is a cisgender male and a decorated Olympic swimmer with:

- 50% lower production of lactic acid
- A disproportionate wingspan
- Double jointed ankles

Phelps has never had his ability to compete questioned despite his natural
advantages.


### Transphobia Hurts Black Women {.pny}

Caster Semenya is a South African runner who is intersex

In order to be allowed to compete, she was forced to undergo
<span class="pny">medical treatment</span> to reduce her
<span class="pny">natural</span> testosterone levels

Cis women Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi are Nambian sprinters
<span class="pny">falsely accused</span> of being trans and are now
<span class="pny">unable to compete</span> due to their natural testosterone
levels


### Ask Yourself {.pnb}

How much testosterone is in your body? Are you sure you're playing a sport as
the "correct" gender?

Legislators in Florida passed the bill <span class="pnb">HB 1475</span> which
allows routine genital inspections of
<span class="pnb">high school students</span> to participate in school sports.
Who do you trust to routinely inspect your genitals? What if it were your child?

Are you concerned about facing transphobia if <span class="pnb">you</span> do
not look or act the way <span class="pnb">other people</span> think cis men and
cis women should?
