During my time as oSTEM's
[Founding President](previous.html#ostem_fp),
the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the organization folded.
One of my dreams when becoming a council member for the CCI DEI Council in
October 2020 was to rebuild oSTEM. However, I knew it wasn't realistic. The
recognition process takes too long and I wouldn't have the bandwidth to act as
president when we would have achieved recognition in my senior year. When the
DEI Council was announced to the college, a student reached out to me about what
they could do to get involved with LGBTQ+ DEI work at Drexel. I shared a few
resources with them. Then, in February of 2021, a second unrelated student from
a different class approached me asking about oSTEM and what events we were
hosting. I told them that sadly, oSTEM had folded and we were not hosting
events. The student asked what we'd need to do to rebuild oSTEM. After
explaining the process, we set out to find a new executive board. I reached out
to the student from the previous term. Within a few hours, the two of them had
formed a new executive board to revive oSTEM.

Given I do not have the time to serve as president, but still want to be active
in the organization, I've been acting as a student advisor to the group. Now
that I've led the group through the recognition process, I've been working to
connect the group to the resources I have available in addition to hosting an
event here and there.
