Drexel University's College of Computing and Informatics

In October 2020, I became one of three undergraduate students on the inaugural
[CCI Diversity Equity and Inclusion Council](https://drexel.edu/cci/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-council/)
In this role I:

- Meet twice monthly with the council to discuss events, initiatives, and
	college wide communications
- Meet at least once monthly with Council Chair outside of council meetings to 
	enact additional initiatives
- Organized an event with student organizations
	[oSTEM](#ostem),
	[QPOC](https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/qpoc),
	and [QSU](https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/queer-student-union)
	for National Pride Month.
	- Set up a table for the day in the CCI 10th floor lobby with
		[informational flyers](../ccideitabling)
	on gender affirming professional wear.
	- Created a [website](../ccideitabling)
		for students to access the information if they could not attend the
		event.
	- Raffled off three books about building a more affirming closet.
	- Many LGBTQ+ students use college as a chance to express themselves
		authentically for the first time. This incredibly formative experience
		can bring many unexpected challenges that other students already
		learned much earlier in life such as wearing ties and applying make up.
		This is also a challenge many first-generation college students face.
		The flyers at the event aimed to provide students with this
		assumed-to-be-common knowledge.
- Lead the initiative to include sanitary trash receptacles in the stalls of the
	men's restroom. These were installed in March 2022.

- Lead the initiative to include staff and faculty pronouns on the
	[College Directory](https://drexel.edu/cci/about/directory/)
	- Planning started in Summer of 2020
	- Data collection started October 2021 on
		[International Pronouns Day](https://pronounsday.org/)
	- Educational materials I created were also released both internally to all
		faculty and staff, and externally to the public
