I'm currently working remotely as a coordinator for the CCI DEI Council I used
to be a member of.
I'm really excited to work here during my gap year and have the chance to
continue the activism work I've done at Drexel in a formal position.
In addition to planning events and initiatives, I have been working to create
formal processes to streamline tasks that were originally handled manually by
the council chair.
This allows the council to work more effectively and provide more proactive
programming.
