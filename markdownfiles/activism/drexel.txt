Drexel University

This work started the moment I arrived at Drexel in the fall of my freshmen
year. My teaching assistant for my introductory computer science course learned
my legal name. He used it to refer to me instead "Charlie", my actual name,
because he found it funny how uncomfortable I was. After much hesitation, I
reported the incident to the professor. That winter, I was hired as a teaching
assistant. As a result of the incident, all teaching assistants were required to
attend a workshop on respecting marginalized groups, specifically talking about
the impact teaching assistants have on freshmen. This training had no
information about the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. These events mark the start of
my activism career at Drexel. I've included a timeline of major events along
with resources, photos, and articles where applicable. It's a sort of scrapbook
of my career and it makes me happy to read back on.

- **September 2018** : Unofficially founded
	[oSTEM at Drexel University](#ostem) under the Center for the Advancement of
	STEM Learning and Teaching Excellence (CASTLE) until getting officially
	recognized as a self governed student organization in Fall 2019.
- **November 2018** : Attended the
	[2018 President's Award Ceremony](https://drexel.edu/hr/about/events/presawards/about/pastwinners/2018Winners/)
	alongside CASTLE to accept the Award for Diversity & Inclusive Community
	with them.

- **May 2019** : Met with CCI Administration regarding the exclusivity of the
	Grace Hopper Celebration communications. Only students assigned female at
	birth were invited to attend the conference free of cost. This included
	transgender men and nonbinary students while also excluding transgender
	women from this opportunity. The issue was resolved. Now communication is
	sent to all students, regardless of gender. Female identifying students are
	encouraged to attend for their own support. Non-female identifying students
	are encouraged to attend to listen and learn in order to better support
	their peers.
- **October 2019** : Collaborated with the Society of Women Engineers in their
	annual _Lives and Lessons of the Underrepresented in STEM Conference_ on
	behalf of oSTEM. I helped organize the event, was a panelist in the
	academia panel, and hosted an activity about identity. Photos:

- **February 2020** : Publicly voiced the discrimination I face as an LGBTQ+
	student to the Dean of CCI at a _Donuts with the Dean_ event. The concerns
	addressed include the inaccessibility and safety of restrooms on campus,
	consistent dismissal of my identity by students, faculty, and staff, and the
	way the Dean ostracized me in the restroom. Previously the gender-neutral
	restrooms had been closed for many months due to plumbing issues. Within a
	week after the event, the bathroom was available for use again.
