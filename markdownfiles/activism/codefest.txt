[Philly Codefest](https://drexel.edu/cci/partnerships/community-engagement/philly-codefest/)
is Drexel's annual hackathon.
This year the event is taking a hybrid format and will be hosted April 4th
through April 9th. I don't think I'll have time to compete this year, but I
might. It may be fun to go back after
[my team won in 2018](../projects/previous.html#comfy).

Leading up to the hackathon, many student organizations and sponsors were
invited to host workshops. I hosted a workshop on behalf of
[oSTEM](previous.html#ostem) about building authentic diversity, not just
sporting a rainbow logo in June.

Slides, recording, and breakdown in progress. It's finals week.
