My personal site found at <https://charlierose.dev> (yes this one you're on
right now). It feels a little cheap to include the website I build as an ongoing
project. However, I don't intend on taking it down, and everytime I want to
have new features, I need to implement them myself. So the site stays, no matter
how redundant it may be.

This started as a very basic site to expand my resume. I've now turned it into
more of a portfolio. As I've needed more, the site's turned into a little
challenge for me in how much I can replicate flashy responsive websites using
only Bash and static HTML.
