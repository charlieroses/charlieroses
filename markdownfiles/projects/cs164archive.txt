This project encapsulates all the work I've put into the course
CS-164 : Introduction to Computer Science at Drexel University in my time as
Head Teaching Assistant. As I finish through my senior year and the Fall and
Winter courses finish up, I'll add everything to the archive and close this
massive chapter of my life. The archive will include:

1. My work from when I took CS-164 in Fall 2017
	* <https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~src322/old164/>
2. The text companion for the lecture material I wrote
	* <https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~src322/cs164/>
3. The labs and assignments I wrote and edited
	* <https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~src322/cs164/labs/>
4. The grading system I developed for grading 300+ students among 10+ TAs
5. Lectures I recorded during the COVID-19 quarantine
6. Other miscellaneous resources I created
