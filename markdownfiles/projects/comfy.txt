PhillyCodefest is the annual hackathon Drexel's College of Computing and
Informatics (CCI) hosts. The theme in 2018 was "computing for social good". I
signed up to attend my freshmen year because I had never done a hackathon before
and wanted to try it out. I didn't have a team or an idea until a week before
the event. I was out with my friend helping him with an assignment. We decided
to go out to dinner at a restaurant he heard was good, so we put in a
reservation. When we got there, it was dark, tight, and loud. My friend is
autistic and I also have sensory issues. We quickly both checked in with each
other to make sure we'd be able to get through dinner. We were both fine, but we
wished we had known sooner what the restaurant would be like. In that moment, I
had my idea for the hackathon.

The goal behind Comfy was to create a crowd sourced review app focused around
accessibility. Users would be able to enter a location and provide information
about the general environment. Our goal was a combination between Yelp and
<www.doesthedogdie.com>. We included criteria like "smoker friendly",
"wheelchair accessible", "bright lights", and "loud music". We tried to choose
common triggers that affect both physical and mental disabilities. When we
presented these categories, we framed them in an objective "expect this" or
"don't expect this" instead of "this exists and that's a bad thing". For
example, Hard Rock Cafe wouldn't make sense if rock music wasn't playing while
you're dining. Hard Rock Cafe is an obvious example. Our goal was to provide to
provide clear expectations of places and experiences so disabled people can make
the best decisions for themselves.

Since we were building a web app centered around accessibility, we needed to
make sure our app was accessible too. We spent a large portion of the hackathon
researching how to make sites more accessible. We found dyslexia friendly fonts,
chose colors that were colorblind friendly, and added proper image alt text for
screen readers. It was for this initiative we won our award.
