I mentioned with the [CARDIAC earrings](#cardiacearrings) that I make so many
earrings, that it's not worth my time to post all of them. These are more
computer themed earrings though, so I figured I should.

Originally, I was just going to make
[Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant) earrings, since it
would just be a paperclip glued to paper. Then my friend suggested I also make
[Glenda](https://9p.io/plan9/glenda.html)
and the
[Go Gopher](https://go.dev/blog/gopher)
in honor of
[my research on Plan 9](../research/index.html#ugthesis).
I also adore all of
[Renee French](https://www.instagram.com/reneefrench/)'s
art, so I'm happy to make a pair of earrings featuring her characters.

Apparently people don't like Clippy too much, but I find him quite charming.
It's a similar type of nostalgic charm that the
[Windows XP Hills Wallpaper](../blogposts/20220112/riowallpaper.html)
minesweeper, MS Paint, and the cascading cards in solitaire have. I wanna do
more projects incorporating these. The Clippy earrings were fun and easy to
make. It's just a

glued to a piece of paper with googley eyes. They look absolutely adorable.

[[Glenda]](files/Earrings_Glenda.png)
and the
[[Gopher]](files/Earrings_GoGopher.png)
required a bit more work. They were both made out of
[[polymer clay]](files/Earrings_GGUnbake.png).
The required sculpting and baking and I accidentally
[[burnt]](files/Earrings_GGBurnt.png)
them.
This means I had to spend even more time
[[painting]](files/Earrings_GGPrime.png)
them to cover up the burn marks. Getting an even textureless paint job requires
many watered down layers of acrylic paint. So it took a solid day of waiting for
paint to dry to cover the burns completely. I was able to assemble Glenda before
painting since she's much more uniformly colored than the Gopher. I baked the
extremities separately, then used ~~failed Clippys~~ broken paperclips to
[[connect]](files/Earrings_GopherApart.png)
the pieces. So far, they've held together.
