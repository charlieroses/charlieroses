<p>
I mentioned in my
<a href="../20211201/aocd1.html">day 1 post</a>
that I didn't know how long I'd last in Advent of Code this year. I want to
continue getting better at C and not rely on Python for the harder problems like
I did in past years. Sadly, I've got a lot going on at the moment, so I'm not
gonna try and convince myself that I have a chance of finishing. I'm gonna try
anyway, see how far I get and progressively add to this post. Then on December
25th, no matter where I'm at, I'll post it.
</p>
<p>
Flash forward a few weeks: I stopped writing about days on Day 4. Then I stopped
doing problems at midnight on Day 8. I've had time to go back and do Day 9 and 10.
I've been beyond busy with finishing final grades, graduate school applications,
and also taking my break from classes. I honestly forgot about
this post I had started until I went to start a new one. Overall, I think I did
a lot better this year compared to past years. I wish I had more time to finish
more days, but I did a lot better in C than I did in Python in past years. I
also started building a library in C for Advent of Code. I want to keep filling
this in with data structure and algorithm implementations. I'm not sure how much
time I'll have in the future to work on this though.

<p>
I don't know if these problems are easier than years past or if I've gotten more
competent. The navigation problem is a classic one. I probably could've shaved
at least a minute off my time if I had multiplied the depth and horizontal
distance from the start. I also forgot that <code>scanf</code> doesn't include spaces when
it grabs strings, which led to a slight bug I needed to fix. Either way, I
continue to do quite a bit better than years past.

<p>
I misread this problem SO MANY times. Spent too long debugging, realizing I had
misread the problem again, then restarting debugging. I also, in my speed code
writing frenzy, proceeded to forget everything I knew about binary, so that was
fun.
</p>
<p>
I did do better than last year in part 1, which I'm happy about. Part 2 is a
different story. I made the classic rookie mistake of not storing the input to
reference in part 2. I'll get better tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
If I do get through tomorrow, I will have completed an equal amount of
Advent of Code problems in C and Python. Then in two days, I'll be able to say
I've technically done the majority of Advent of Code in C.

<p>
Today was significantly more relaxing and enjoyable than yesterday. Debugging
was more straight forward, I didn't make silly mistakes. There was a BINGO
theme. It was a nice confidence boost after yesterday.
</p>
<p>
I have officially completed an equal number of challenges in C and Python. It's
been really nice to see how much I've improved since I've started.

<p>
I started doing day 8 at midnight, then I saw part 2 and decided to call it for
the night.
From what I can tell, day 8 was universally tough for part 2.
I have conflicting feelings about my part 2 solutions.
I like how I used integers and bits to mimic a set.
I'm not proud of how I went about finding each number in the 4bit7seg.
This was the last day I even partially finished the day it was released.

<p>
Another one of those problems I completed about a week after it was released, so
I'm not gonna include statistics.
</p>
<p>
I liked this problem.
It's a variation of a problem I did in my data structures class.
I'm TAing the same class in the winter.
When I took the class, I did it in Python.
This year, they started moving over to C.
This problem took a lot longer than I was expecting since I took the time to
write my own stack in C.
Other than that, it was a fun straight forward problem.
</p>
<h3 class="ag" id="language-stats-">Language Stats </h3>
<p>
This doesn't add up exactly. I can't find my 2018 solutions anywhere, then I
also did some days in both languages.
