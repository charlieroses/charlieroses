	<h1 id="broken-links-on-the-site">Broken Links on the Site</h1>
<p>I tend not to write blogposts about the little scripts I write to organize my website. They tend to be fairly basic bash scripts and I don't find them exceptionally interesting or special. Though, the script I just wrote is too funny to ignore. <del>It's also quite embarrassing, but I'm choosing to laugh at this instead of be hurt by it</del></p>
<p>I've built just about the entire &quot;framework&quot; for my site here. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/charlieroses/charlieroses">GitHub</a> or read more about it <a href="../../projects/#devsite">here</a>. I frequently update these scripts as I add more pages to my site and want to create new functionality. I try to write scripts that don't require much upkeep so that I don't have to rewrite the scripts every time I add to my site. I'm slowly getting closer to &quot;self sufficient&quot; and most of the time when I add content, I don't need to rewrite the entire &quot;framework&quot;. One of the things I did today was start to compartmentalize the <a href="https://github.com/charlieroses/charlieroses/blob/main/utils/build">build script</a> into multiple smaller <a href="https://github.com/charlieroses/charlieroses/tree/main/utils">build scripts</a> so I don't need to rebuild the entire site if I only change one page in one section. This got fairly time consuming as I add more content.</p>
<p>The other absurd, inefficient, and inaccurate time sink was checking my links. I basically would go through every page I was going to add, then clicked on every link to make sure they all worked. This was absurdly time consuming and wildly inaccurate. Then, when I fixed things in my scripts or changed structure, I didn't go and check every link again, and everything broke. On one hand, it's incredibly embarrassing I went through all of the work of trying to click on every link to check if they worked instead of finding a better solution. On the other hand, it's also hilarious how quickly I was able to figure out how to not do that.</p>
<p>Today, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/charlieroses/charlieroses/blob/main/utils/check_links">bash script</a> to check if the links on the certain page redirect to a page that exists on my site. When I ran the script on all the files in my site, I had another hilariously embarrassing situation. I got to see exactly how many broken links there were on my site. I guess it's embarrassing that I didn't realize how broken my site way. I guess it's embarrassing that I thought that clicking on links repeatedly was a smart solution and that I wouldn't miss the absurd amount of broken links that existed. At this point, I just find it flat out hilarious. It's one of those, &quot;you live and learn&quot; situations.</p>
<p>Anyway, the script took me all of an hour to actually write and fixes so many issues. All it does is cycle through the links I have on the site and check if the files actually exist. It's so simple, I find it hilarious how much effort I put into this before. As a side note, if you happened to stumble across my site and noticed every single link ever was broken, I hope that you didn't think too poorly of me.</p>
