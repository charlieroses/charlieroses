	<h1 id="transgender-day-of-remembrance">Transgender Day of Remembrance</h1>
<p>These past few weeks have been beyond busy and I've gotten a lot done that I've been wanting to write about (undergraduate thesis/graduate school/workshops/etc) but I just haven't had the time to recap. Trans Day of Remembrance is Saturday though, and given the year I've had, I needed to get this down before then.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://www.glaad.org/tdor"><em>Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) is an annual observance on November 20 that honors the memory of the transgender people whose lives were lost in acts of anti-transgender violence.</em></a>&quot;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thehrcfoundation.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> recently released their report titled &quot;<a href="https://reports.hrc.org/an-epidemic-of-violence-fatal-violence-against-transgender-and-gender-non-confirming-people-in-the-united-states-in-2021?_ga=2.100179550.1177496663.1637296745-730696883.1637296745"><em>An Epidemic of Violence: Fatal Violence Against Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People in the United States in 2021</em></a>&quot;. Since January 1st, 46 known trans and gender non-conforming people have been violently killed in the United States. This makes 2021 the deadliest year for transgender people since this data started being collected in 2013. This beats the previous deadliest year for trans people in 2020 where there were 44 known deaths. It is important to recognize that these numbers are inaccurate. The actual count would be much higher, but due to transphobia, these hate crimes may not be recorded accurately or transgender people may be posthumously closeted or misgendered.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2021/">National Survey on LGBTQ+ Youth Mental Health 2021</a> done by <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a>, an LGBTQ+ lifeline, 42% of LGBTQ+ youth have seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. This includes more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth. Then, 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youths have attempted suicide in the past year. The survey also covers statistics regarding housing, food insecurity, poverty, conversion therapy, and other things that serverely impact LGBTQ+ people's health.</p>
<p>While TDOR is tomorrow, November 20th, today Drexel University hosts their services. I am honored to be able to speak at the event alongside other student community leaders before the trans flag is raised over all three of Drexel's campus's. I wrote the following speech on Tuesday (<em>Note: This was editted when I gave it. I included the edits</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trans Day of Remembrance and the services that Drexel hosts are incredibly important to me and I am thankful to be able to speak here. I'm speaking here today, because as a queer transgender man, I have gone through so many unnecessary and preventable layers of shit because of my identity. As a result, I've struggled with depression, addiction, and attempted suicide more than once. No matter how much better it gets, that grief never goes away. So today, I'm speaking because I am lucky I'm not being remembered and I'm not quite sure how long I have to speak before I'll be remembered. A statistic. A name in a list.</p>
<p>You see, everyday I am faced with my own mortality. As trans people, we are forced to confront the reality of how transphobia, hate, poverty, and trauma destroy us and our communities. It affects the transgender community across country and across the world, but most importantly, it affects the people we're standing with in this room. In the face of this harsh reality, it's easy to feel powerless. Today, in addition to the lives we've lost, we need to remember the only way to address this pain is to strengthen our community. We need to protect each other and support each other and care for each other and love each other, the same way we always have been.</p>
<p>Today, let us mourn and grieve the lives we've lost, the lives we remember. Tomorrow, we continue to fight for the lives we're not remembering, the lives we still have, and the lives we will have. Thank you.</p>

<p>I want to take a moment to remember some of the lives lost this year. I want to take the time to not remember them as statistics, but as people. This list is non-exhaustive. The more I searched through news articles, the more names I found. Rest peacefully, may your memories be blessings.</p>

Bell said that one time he was landscaping in his yard and Groves stopped him before he began to trim a tree. &quot;He was like: 'No, you can’t do it like that. That's going to hurt the tree.' And I was like: 'OK, let's go back to the drawing board. Let's figure out something that's good for us but also that’s good for the tree,'&quot; Bell said, laughing. &quot;He cared about everything, especially plants.&quot;</p>
