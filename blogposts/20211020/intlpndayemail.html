<p><img src="drexelcci.png" alt="The Drexel CCI DEI Council Logo"></p>
<p>Dear CCI Students,</p>
<p>Drexel CCI's Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion Council is excited to share that we have launched an initiative offering the opportunity for faculty and professional staff to add pronouns to their website profiles - one of many steps towards fostering an inclusive community - in observance of <a href="https://pronounsday.org/">International Pronouns Day</a> (today, October 20, 2021). Referring to people by the pronouns they determine for themselves is basic to human dignity. Together, we can transform society to celebrate peopleâ€™s multiple, intersecting identities.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://youtu.be/2Z3lfhOcq_0">Watch a video</a> of Drexel CCI student and Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion Council member Charlie Stuart (he/they) to learn more about the importance of pronouns, what they are and how you can implement them into your daily life.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>October is LGBTQ+ History Month,</strong> an annual month-long observance dedicated to honoring the great figures who fought for change and paved the way. We encourage you to learn more about the <a href="https://lgbthistorymonth.com/">rich history online</a> and check out events happening near you. Learning and acknowledging history allows us to create a better future.
