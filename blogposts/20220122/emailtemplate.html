<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> <code>[Issue Overview]</code></p>
<p>Hello <code>[Recipient]</code>,</p>
<p>I hope you're doing well. My name is <code>[Name]</code> and I am <code>[Relevant Role]</code>. I found your contact information at <code>[Website]</code> where it states that you are <code>[Relevant Role]</code>. I am reaching out to you because I would to bring an issue regarding <code>[Issue Overview]</code> to your attention. If you are not the correct individual to address this, could you please direct me to who I should contact instead?</p>
<p>What is your availability so we can set up a meeting to talk and would you prefer to meet over Zoom or in person? My availability is as follows. If there are no common times, please let me know and I can make more availability.</p>
<p><code>[Availability]</code></p>
<p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p><code>[Email Signature]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So replace the <code>[chunks]</code> with whatever information fits there. If you were given their contact information from someone else, I like to CC the person that referred me and then replace the <code>[Website]</code> part too. Something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>[Referrer]</code> and I recently met and they suggested I contact you regarding <code>[Issue Overview]</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the <code>[Issue Overview]</code>, keep it short, simple, and relevant. If you're facing discrimination from a professor, something like &quot;Professor <code>[Name]</code>'s behavior in class&quot; is plenty. This is also a good subject line for the email. Just something that's quick and relevant and opens up future communication.</p>
<p>Then for an email signature, I use the following format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Preferred Name]</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[Full Name]</p>
<p>[Pronouns]</p>
<p>[Contact Information]</p>
<p>[Relevant Title(s)/Information]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So mine is currently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Charles Stuart</p>
<p>He/They</p>
<p>src322@drexel.edu</p>
<p>BS Computer Science - Drexel University 2022</p>
<p>Head Teaching Assistant - Drexel University</p>
<p>Founding President/Student Advisor - Out In Stem (oSTEM) @ Drexel University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your email signature tells people about you. So my full name is technically Charles, but I would prefer for the person I'm contacting to call me Charlie. Then additionally, my pronouns, so they know how to refer to me. You can see my whole <a href="../20211020/intlpronounsday.html">pronouns post</a> talking about pronouns and names. Then, contact information so people can contact you. Some people include their cell phone number or office phone number, fax number or office location. I don't like giving out my cell number to students and I don't have an office, so I've only restated my email.</p>
<p>Then for <code>[Relevant Title(s)/Information]</code> and also in the email template, <code>[Relevant Role]</code>. In the email signature, I've included the top three reasons I'm writing an email. 1) I'm a student contacting my professor. 2) I'm a teaching assistant contacting my student(s). 3) I'm doing LGBTQ+ activism work. Then when I introduce myself in the email, I restate which title is the most relevant. So if I'm contacting my professor, I'll just say &quot;I'm Charlie and I'm a computer science student in your class, CS-123.&quot; since that's the most relevant information.</p>
