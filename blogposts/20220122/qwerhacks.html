<p><a href="https://www.qwerhacks.com/">QWER Hacks @ UCLA</a> is <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking's (MLH)</a> first LGBTQIA+ hackathon. This years theme was <em>Embracing Identity Through Self Empowerment</em> and had four tracks: <em>Community &amp; Connection</em>, <em>Health &amp; Wellness</em>, <em>Learning &amp; Growth</em>, and <em>Art &amp; Expression</em>.</p>
<p>While the event lasted from January 21st through the 23rd, I hosted my workshop on Saturday, the 22nd. This was the first workshop I've ever hosted outside of Drexel and it was pretty exciting to put together. My workshop was titled <em>Accidental Activism in Academia</em> and was focused around my journey in starting my activism work and how to do it intentionally.</p>
<p>I'm gonna spend this post going over my experience at the hackathon, creating my first workshop outside of Drexel, and going more in depth than my slides allow.</p>

<p>[Workshop Recording] Pending</p>
<p>[Slide Breakdown] Pending</p>
<p>I've been very busy this past week and I'm not fully done the slides breakdown. They will be finished by the end of Sunday (1/23), but I wanted to get the slides posted for people coming from my workshop looking for them even if the full explanations aren't finished yet.</p>
<p>Additionally, I wanted to post this before the workshop, so a recording of the workshop doesn't exist yet because it hasn't even happened yet. The slides breakdown will be posted at the same time as the workshop recording.</p>
