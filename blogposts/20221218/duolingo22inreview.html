<p>
I <a href="../20221126/duolingoupdate.html">recently</a> made a post about the Duolingo
learning format update. It was my first post about Duolingo despite spending
nearly two years of my life on the app. I mentioned that I had no idea ifi/when
I would do another post about Duolingo. Looks like everything worked out a lot
sooner than I was expecting.
</p>
<p>
A while ago, I got a notification to see my
<a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/year-in-review-behind-the-scenes/">2022 report</a>.
I've been
putting it off because I wanted to get as close to the end of the year as
possible, Then I realized that the statistics were compiled on November 30th, so
there was no point in waiting.
</p>
<h2 id="by-the-numbers">By The Numbers</h2>
<p>
As of November 30th, 2022, I...
</p>
<ul>
<li>
... completed <span class="blue">1003 lessons</span> in Italian with an
average lesson accuracy of <span class="blue">over 90%</span>
</li>
<li>
... was among the <span class="gold">top 2%</span> of all learners this year,
earned <img src="xp.png"> <span class="xp">28833 experience</span>
</li>
<li>
... spent <span class="purple">3253 minutes</span> learning. That's a little
over <span class="purple">54 hours</span>. My longest day was
<span class="purple"> July 31st</span> with <span class="purple">111
minutes</span>. <i>(We had just started our cross country road trip and I
don't drive)</i>
</li>
<li>
... learned <span class="blue">702 new words</span> and practiced
<span class="blue">2553 sentences</span>.
</li>
<li>
... hit a <img src="streak.png"> <span class="streak">510 Day Streak</span>. As I
write this post on December 18th, I currently have a
<img src="streak.png"> <span class="streak">528 Day Streak</span>. Apparently only
<span class="streak">5.8%</span> of learners make it into the
"<a href="https://duoplanet.com/duolingo-streak-society/">Duolingo Streak Society</a>".
<i>(My app doesn't have this feature... I had to Google it. Basically, I have
a streak lasting longer than 365 days)</i>
</li>
<li>
... made it to the <img src="diamond.png"> <span class="diamond">Diamond League</span>
more than once. I spent <span class="diamond">14 nonconsequetive weeks</span>
there.
</li>
<li>
... made <span class="blue">4 friends</span> on Duolingo and congratulated
them <span class="blue">54 times</span>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Duolingo then revealed my learning style is <span class="galactic">"Galactic
Legend"</span>. It looks like this has nothing to do with learning practices and
instead just puts me in the <span class="galactic">top 2% of learners
worldwide</span>.

<h2 id="other-updates">Other Updates</h2>
<p>
I've been using the new learning path update for about a month now, so I think
I can start to build opinions.
</p>
<p>
When I got the update, given my progress I was placed into Unit 21 "Tell others
what to do, discuss student life" with everything including Unit 20 "Speak
Formally" completed to the <span class="legendary">legendary</span> level.
</p>
<p>
Now, on December 18th, 2022, I have made the following progress:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 21</b> : Tell others what to do, discuss student
life</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="gold"><b>Unit 22</b> : Talk About Travel</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="gold"><b>Unit 23</b> : Give directions, describe your childhood</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Unit 24</b> : Express Feelings
<ul>
<li>
<span class="gold">Give Directions</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="gold">Talk about travel (Hard)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="gold">Personalized Practice</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="gold">Story: An Important Job</span>
</li>
<li>
Express Feelings (2/7)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I am definitely progressing A LOT faster than before, but I'm not exactly sure I
enjoy how fast I'm progressing. My original sentiments still ring true. I don't
feel like my progress matches how well I understand a topic. One, I'm not
getting nearly as much exposure to new content before even newer content is
introduced. Two, the difficulty of the lessons has gone down dramatically. I
can't tell if this is related to how quickly new topics are introduced, so I'm
only getting the "beginner" lessons for each section. It appears as though even
the "Hard" lessons are really simple.
</p>
<p>
I just completed the "Hard" lesson for "Talk about travel". It's still primarily
exercises where I'm choosing the right words from a word box. I don't get many
opportunities where I'm given a text box to type my answer in, which I prefer
because it forces me to remember more. The Unit 22 Guidebook has some "tips" and
"phrases", but not nearly enough to be prepared for all the things I'll get
mistakes on. There are grammar things that I wish were covered like when to use
<i>di</i> vs <i>da</i> vs <i>in</i> vs <i>a</i>. Then also, when referring to countries, it looks
like "the" is used a lot more, but it's not clear when to use <i>Asia</i> vs <i>l'Asia</i>.
Even for vocab, what's the difference between <i>pullman</i> and <i>autobus</i>. I've also
given <i>aeroplano</i> when the app wanted <i>aereo</i> quite a few times. These are just
the cognates. I'm definitely struggling even more with new words like <i>valigia</i>
(suitcase) and <i>pagella</i> (report card). For me, the word bank instead of an
empty text box is making is a lot harder for me to know words. I feel like my
reading comprehension is great. Even if I don't know a word, I can still make
out its meaning from the words around it. But if I'm speaking or writing, I find
myself struggling to remember words.
</p>
<p>
On a lighter note, I was orignally critical of the way practice is done now. I
think I've mostly changed my mind. I do enjoy the Personalized Practice
sessions. These aren't like the regular practice to gain hearts which is what I
was expecting. These are like lessons where if you make a mistake, you lose a
heart. I think the Personalizd Practice does a much better job of combining
content from different lessons into one generalized lesson. Instead of having
a set of travel exercises, it feels a little more natural to have a travel
exercise, then an education exercise, then a formal grammar exercise.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I'm proud of my Duolingo obsession. I'm not stopping anytime soon. I
just need to find new ways to supplement Duolingo. I have a few physical Italian
books I can use. I might try to write more blogposts in Italian too. We'll see.
