	<h1 id="the-duolingo-update">The Duolingo Update</h1>
<p>
<i>Note: This accidentally got posted earlier than I expected.</i>
<i>Updated 11/26/2022</i>
</p>
<p>
For quite a while now, I've been teaching myself Italian.
This has been a little difficult as I have no one to talk to, but I've been
taking advantage of the resources I have available:
using Italian commands for my dog,
writing shopping lists, notes to myself, and journal entries in Italian,
taking the only Italian courses Drexel offers
(<a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=ITAL%20101">ITAL-101</a>
and <a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=ITAL%20102">ITAL-102</a>),
and constantly using language learning apps.
So far I've tried
<a href="https://www.babbel.com/">Babbel</a>,
<a href="https://languagedrops.com/">Drops</a>,
<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>,
and <a href="https://lingodeer.com/">Lingodeer</a>
At some point I wanna do a blog post comparing and ranking these apps.
Until then, I'll quickly say Duolingo is my favorite with Drops in second place.
I wasn't a fan of Babbel or Lingodeer.
</p>
<p>
In September, Duolingo
<a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/new-duolingo-home-screen-design/">announced</a>
that they would be updating their home screen and learning path on November 1st.
I am very excited for this update, but I'm also a little concerned.
First about how my progress will be affected.
I don't exactly use Duolingo the way they
<a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/whats-the-best-way-to-learn-with-duolingo/">recommend</a>.
Instead, I go row by row, getting each unit to level 1, then 2, etc all the way
to the legendary purple color.
I do this with video games too, I like to "complete" everything I can in a level
before moving onto the next.
The announcement talks about how progress won't be lost, but I'm still
concerned about how levels from different lessons will end up being spliced
together.
Then I'm also a little concerned because I've been dedicated to Duolingo for a long
time now, I really hope this change doesn't kill my motivation.
</p>
<p>
To ease my concerns, I figured I would do a blog post "saving" my progress.
First, to provide my unsolicited opinions on the update.
Second, I'm proud of what I've accomplished and I'll take my opportunity to
brag.

<p>
<i>Note: I didn't receive the update until November 11th. I am writing this post
on November 26th based on the screenshot I have from the 11th.</i>
</p>
<p>
I joined Duolingo in December of 2018.
Today, November 11th, 2022, I have a
<img src="streak.png"> <span class="streak">491 Day Streak</span>
and
<img src="xp.png"> <span class="xp">54183 Total Experience</span>,
I'm in my second week in the
Obsidian League
and have had
<img src="top3.png"> <span class="xp">17 Top 3 Finishes</span>.
</p>
<p>
I have only 3 achievements that haven't been maxed out:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Challenger</b> (Level 4) : Earn XP in the leaderboard's timed challenges
(861/1000)
</li>
<li>
<b>Scholar</b> (Level 9) : Learn 1500 new works in a single course (1.2K/1.5K)
</li>
<li>
<b>Page Turner</b> (Level 4) : Complete stories (51/60)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The achievements I <i>had</i> maxed out are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Wildfire</b> (Level 10)</span> : Reach a 365-day streak
</li>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Sage</b> (Level 10)</span> : Earn 30000 XP
</li>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Champion</b> (Level 10)</span> : Make it to the
<span class="diamond">Diamond League</span>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Winner</b> (Level 1)</span> : Finish #1 in the leaderboard
</li>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Legendary</b> (Level 1)</span> : Finish #1 in the
<span class="diamond">Diamond League</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Friendly</b> (Level 1)</span> : Follow 3 Friends
</li>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Weekend Warrior</b> (Level 1)</span> : Complete a lesson on
Saturday and Sunday
</li>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Photogenic</b> (Level 1)</span> : Add a profile picture
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In terms of the actual content, for the <b>Stories</b>, I completed all 51 stories
available.
As for lessons, I was trying to finish to get to Unit 3 before the update, which
I was able to successfully do!
Like I mentioned before, I progress by getting a set of skills to
<span class="legendary">Legendary</span>
before starting a new set.
This leaves me with the following

<h2 id="postupdate-progress">Post-Update Progress</h2>
<p>
Overall, my experience and achievements stayed the same.
I'm finally updating this post on November 26th, 2022 (work has been really busy
and I'm not allowed to make any updates until January).
</p>
<p>
In the new learning path, my progress translates to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 1:</b> Use basic phrases, describe basic actions</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 2:</b> Greet people, talk about food</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 3:</b> Form the plural</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 4:</b> Talk about animals, talk about food and drink</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 5:</b> Describe possessions</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 6:</b> Discuss clothing, ask questions</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 7:</b> Talk about the present</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 8:</b> Describe colors, form complex sentences</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 9:</b> Talk about places, express dates and times</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 10:</b> Describe your family, talk about quantity</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 11:</b> Talk about occupations</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 12:</b> Describe your home</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 13:</b> Talk about habits, use adverbs</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 14:</b> Describe places, identify common objects</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 15:</b> Describe people, use pronouns</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 16:</b> Use numbers</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 17:</b> Describe what's around you</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 18:</b> Use the present perfect, describe people</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 19:</b> Use the infinitive, use pronouns</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Unit 20:</b> Speak formally</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Unit 21:</b> Tell others what to do, discuss student life
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was placed about halfway through Unit 21 at the "Discuss student life" lesson.
This matched where I was with Unit 3 starting with the Education lesson.
The first crown/level in Education was equivalent to the completed "Discuss
student life" lesson.
There are 51 units total in the Italian Duolingo course, as opposed to the
original 4.
I'm still about halfway done the course.
</p>
<p>
I lost quite a bit of progress on the stories.
They're now interlaced with the regular content.
I'm okay with it though.
</p>
<h2 id="opinions">Opinions</h2>
<p>
I completed Unit 21 and moved onto Unit 22: Talk about travel.
I'm not sure how I feel about the update.
I don't think I like it, but not enough to stop using the app.
</p>
<p>
I don't feel like I'm being prepared enough to progress.
In the old format, each lesson had 5 levels.
Each level has the same number of sub-lessons.
I don't know what words Duolingo uses to refer to each section and subsection,
but let me put it side by side:
</p>
<p>
<b>Old Format</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Talk about travel in Unit 3 (See above for a better idea of what a full unit
looks like)
<ul>
<li>
<b>Level 0:</b> 10 Lessons introducing new vocabulary. For example 1/10 may
be words like "trip" and "vacation" and 2/10 may have words like
"airplane" and "airport". Etc. The last lesson is the "test" to get the
crown.
</li>
<li>
<b>Level 1:</b> The same 10 lesson format with the same sections in the same
order, you now have to option to type words with your keyboard instead
of selecting from a box
</li>
<li>
<b>Level 2:</b> Same 10 lesson format, more writing and more complex
sentences
</li>
<li>
<b>Level 3:</b> Ditto (I'm gonna be honest I forget exactly how the
complexity increased, but I know it did get harder)
</li>
<li>
<b>Level 4:</b> Ditto
</li>
<li>
<span class="xp"><b>Level 5:</b></span> Completed. Will turn gold. Sometimes
will "break" and you have to practice it to fix it. You have the option
to pay 400 gems to completed 4 lessons (100 per lesson) to get
legendary. Each lesson you are only allowed 3 mistakes total and cannot
click on words to see their translations.
</li>
<li>
<span class="legendary"><b>Legendary:</b></span> Fully completed. Turns
purple. Can still "break" and requires practicing to "fix"
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>New Format</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unit 22: Talk about Travel
<ul>
<li>
Speak formally
<ul>
<li>
Has a "HARD" label
</li>
<li>
Seen in Unit 20 (I assume Level 0 equivalent)
</li>
<li>
Seen in Unit 21 (I assume Level 1 equivalent)
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Talk about travel
<ul>
<li>
Equivalent to Level 0
</li>
<li>
I am here. I have not unlocked the rest of this unit, so I'm gonna be
making assumptions
</li>
<li>
Will reappear in Unit 23 (I assume Level 1 equivalent)
</li>
<li>
Will reappear in Unit 24 with "HARD" label (I assume Level 2 equivalent)
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Personalized practice
</li>
<li>
An Interesting Conversation
<ul>
<li>
Story
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Discuss student life
<ul>
<li>
Assuming Level 1 equivalent
</li>
<li>
Last seen in Unit 21 (Level 0 equivalent)
</li>
<li>
Will reappear in Unit 23 with "HARD" label (I assume Level 2 equivalent)
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Tell others what to do
<ul>
<li>
Has a "HARD" label
</li>
<li>
Seen in Unit 21 (I assume Level 0 equivalent)
</li>
<li>
Seen in Unit 21 (I assume Level 1 equivalent)
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Personalized practice
</li>
<li>
I'm Ready!
<ul>
<li>
Story
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Unit 22 Review
</li>
</li>
</li>
</li>
</li>
</li>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I see how the design is more integrated.
It's kinda similar to the approach I had of completing a level then moving onto
the next level in the next lesson, then bouncing back to an old level.
</p>
<p>
I just feel unprepared to complete a unit.
The "Unit 21 Review" included lots of education words that I kinda knew, but
wasn't prepared for.
It typically takes me a few lessons to realize when to use certain words.
For example, when do I use classe (class), corso (course), or lezione
(lesson/lecture)?
When do I use liceo (high school) instead of scuola superiore (high school)?
It things like this that get put in the review and I get errors on, but they're
not listed in the Unit Guidebook (notes on how to use the new words and grammar
rules).
It's the things you just learn by using the language more.
</p>
<p>
This makes it super hard to get the legendary level which I love because 1) I'm
a bit of a completionist when it comes to video games and 2) I like purple more
than gold.
The Legendary trophy now applies to the full unit and it now takes 8 lessons
instead of 4.
These lessons are significantly harder than they used to.
I'm not sure if it's because I have less practice or if they're actually more
difficult.
I just feel like I'm not ready to go for a legendary trophy for education if I
only have one "crown" in "Discuss student life".
Even if I were to complete all three levels that exist for "Discuss student
life", I still feel unprepared to get the legendary trophy.
It makes me a lot less motivated to move on.
</p>
<p>
I also really liked how skills broke.
It allowed me to go back and chose where I'd focus my practice time.
Each day, two "completed" (gold/legendary) skills broke.
On days where I was "burnt out" and didn't want to struggle through a new
lesson, I would go through and repair my broken lessons as practice.
During practice, you don't lose hearts, so you're free to make errors and learn
from them.
You won't get kicked out of a lesson if you run out of hearts.
It took a lot of pressure out of learning.
Now, there are these built in "Personalized Practice" lessons, but I'm forced to
do them at certain times and if I make mistakes, they cost hearts.
I can still go backwards and choose which lessons I'd like to practice, but now
it's only worth 5xp instead of 20xp even though the type of practice exercises
haven't changed.
I have not checked if this form of practice earns hearts the way it has in the
past.
I can also "Practice to earn hearts" which chooses a lesson at random to
practice and earns a heart and 15xp.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I'm a bit disappointed in the update.
I'm not gonna stop using Duolingo.
I don't think I'd be able to stop even if I wanted to.
It would be pretty heartbreaking to break my current
<img src="streak.png"> <span class="streak">506 day streak</span>.
I don't know if I'll do another Duolingo update in the future.
I might come back and do a "2 Years on Duolingo" update once I hit a 730 day
streak.
We'll see where this new format takes me.
A dopo, ciao.
